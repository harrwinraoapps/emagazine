&lt;p&gt;Gita Samarpanam is a group born out of the vision and initiation of Aunty Jegadeva to recite the verses of Chapter 12 on Bhakti Yoga or Path of Devotion from the most revered holy book - the Bhagavad Gita. It is to be an offering to Bhagawan on Ladies Day for the year 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I grabbed this opportunity to be a part of the sadhana not only as an offering but more importantly to learn to chant the verses. Having tried unsuccessfully and intimidated by the Sanskrit verses, I had given up learning the Bhagavad Gita altogether. Now, with this opportunity, I had it all beautifully planned and laid out smoothly for me, right in the comfort of my home. Classes were to be conducted through Zoom conferencing, in light of the coronavirus pandemic. What a blessing!!!
Classes commenced on the 22nd of June 2020 and it was conducted by Sister Girija, who was well versed in the subject as she was exposed to spirituality at a tender age. She had grown up on the lap of her uncle, the spiritual leader, Swami Chinmayananda. We were blessed to have her teaching us. Sister Girija began her sadhana with an introduction into the scene of the Kurukshetra war and a glimpse into Chapter 12. I was completely blown away and thought to myself “what had I missed all my life”. It has taken me six decades to get a peek into this treasure trove of wisdom. “Well, better late than never”, I consoled myself. By the end of the first class I was in bliss and I was beaming with happiness. From then on, I began to yearn to know more and experienced an indescribable feeling of pure joy after each session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sister Girija began to unravel the meaning of each verse on Arjuna’s enquiry to Lord Krishna. Her explanations were soul stirring and she narrated stories and shared life experiences of great saints thereby demonstrating her vast knowledge on the Bhagavad Gita. It was a real treat to all who were blessed to attend and gain her insights. Her constant encouragement to keep our enthusiasm and earnest longing to learn gave us the inspiration to do our best in the chanting of the verses. A mammoth task lay in front of me that needed a lot of effort. I realised that in order to transform this knowledge into bhakti, I would need to integrate it with my life or “it will be a useless tinsel”, as said by Adi Shankara. Practice, practice and practice is now my constant reminder. Doable by making small steps echoes my inner voice.
It took Sister Girija 10 days to complete the 20 verses and then she taught us the Bhagavad Gita Dhyanam or Meditation on the Gita.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These verses are sung before the recitation or as an invocation to the Gita. All the verses learnt have such a profound meaning in my life now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of a sudden, the Covid-19 cases began to rise again and we faced another movement control order. The pandemic now challenged us to complete our offering together in conjunction with Ladies Day 2020. All of us (SSBC Bandar Klang was represented by Sis Jenobai, Sis Nirmala, Sis Sudha and myself with Sis Nageswary from Sri Muda Centre joining us) held on strongly to shraddha or faith in the Lord with no doubt. We were then advised that each centre would need to record their recital (we were given 4 verses to recite) and these recordings would then be compiled to be presented to our Bhagavan on the 19th of November. With divine grace, we gathered in Sister Nirmala’s house on the 18th of October for the video recording. With the kind effort of Bro Naveen, Sis Chandini, Bro Lekshman and all the sisters, we completed our task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, we are continuing our revision on all the 20 verses from Chapter 12 and will humbly present it to our Swami with all our love and gratitude on the 19th of November 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am ever so grateful to Aunty Jegadeva and Sis Girija for making it possible to be a part of this sadhana. Most of all, my humble salutations to Bhagavan for without His Divine Grace, this would never have been possible as “Not a Blade of Grass Moves Without His Will”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Family is EVERYTHING</title>
        <link>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/family-is-everything/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

&lt;p&gt;Amidst the widespread of Covid-19 we have all been lifted into another way of living. Our lives have been slowed down by an amazingly small organism with a huge amount of power. In March 2020, when the Movement Control Order was announced, there was sudden fear and panic everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day presented us with a new set of rules and changes that gave us a reason to pause. Schools closing, kids zoning out during endless Zoom classes, holiday plans cancelled. There was so much uncertainty and a feeling of being out of control. My world somewhat came to a pause. I had so many questions on my mind, how do I put this together? I need to continue working, my kids needed to keep the momentum going with lessons, my staff needed direction, I wouldn’t be seeing my mother whom I met every day and many more. It was a choice we needed to make on being careful and social distancing to keep the young ones and elderly safe even though we stayed so close to each other. Of course, there was my husband holding the fort together, and I too felt that we must deal with this together as we had little lives dependent on us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is then I sat and calmed myself and told myself - you’ve got this! Instead of asking, “When will this all end?” I asked, “How can I grow from this?” Swami once said,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why get agitated? Let Me take care of all your business. I shall be the one who will think about them. I am waiting for nothing else than your surrender to Me, and then you do not have to worry anymore about anything. Say farewell to all fears and discouragement.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I began positive self-talk. It’s amazing how positive self-talk influences your subconscious mind and reveals thoughts, beliefs and ideas. As I began doing this daily, I had a sense of calmness and peace. My husband too was of great support to my emotional well-being and kept reassuring me that even this shall pass. I was able to think more clearly, my mind was just on prayer! That is the one thing that was within my control that I could do. I set aside all the unanswered questions and began putting things in action. My girls and I would recite the Gayathri Mantra 108 times every morning, afternoon and evening. Followed by collated prayers with members of the Organisation. The daily prayers then led to self-reflection and gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realised even during the hardest of times there was still so much that I could authentically be grateful for. I woke up and thanked GOD for the air and light. For the ability to see and smell. For this very gift of life and giving me the chance to begin each day. And even if it was for just a few moments a day, I felt so grateful for the tiniest details I noticed around me; for shelter, sunrise, food and the greatest of all was having my family safe and sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started to plan our meals together as a family. I always loved cooking and baking and this was the best time to experiment more, yet being moderate. My girls were taught to prepare very simple meals, we baked together, we sat down and did activities together, we played board games, we designed clothes for their collection of Barbie dolls, we painted together, there were endless movie nights and gardening on top of my daily routine of Working from Home. As days went by, I began to feel more at peace, more joy and surely a deeper sense of gratitude. I looked around me and realised I had my girls and husband, right here beside me. Something I have been longing for for a long time. There were moments in my life as a working mother when I would have the working-mom-guilt. I felt time running so fast to achieve my career aspirations, while my kids were growing up so quickly. But in a blink of an eye even this changed. That’s when I recalled Swami saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Love My Uncertainty&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know how or when the pandemic will end, but I know that the miracle of life is now. I thank Swami for this beautiful gift of life and for my loving family. To me, family is not just an important thing but it is EVERYTHING.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Seek And You Will Find The Inner Peace You Crave</title>
        <link>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/inner-peace/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/inner-peace/</guid>
        <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the coronavirus pandemic reached our shores and the Movement Control Order was announced, I was paradoxically elated. For I chose to look at the positive side, I decided that it was a great opportunity to take a breather from the hectic pace of life that I had become accustomed to. Rather then dwell on the negativity and worry unnecessarily over a virus that was restricting our way of life, I decided to make the most of the situation as best I could. The MCO gave me the opportunity to do all the things that I had always wanted to do but didn’t quite manage due to time constraints and quite frankly, some procrastination. Was I in for a surprise! With two teenagers at home and a husband still working as an essential services staff, I still had my hands full. My mum and I found ourselves in the kitchen most of the time, either cooking, cleaning or browsing through the internet for some easy recipes. It brought much joy in seeing our loved ones savouring our labour of love in preparing delicious and nutritious home cooked food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, when the MCO was extended I spent the time venturing into other interesting and more introspective fields that caught my focus. I dwelled into the Upanishads, dabbled a little in Kundalini Yoga, immersed myself in Deepak Chopra’s 21-day Abundance Program and even signed up for Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering course. In my ardent quest to know “Who Am I”, I found myself embarking on a journey that made me realise that much self-reflection, introspection, contemplation and meditation are required. All the great gurus and sages say the answer is within us. So, we have to make that journey inwards. As inspirational author and guided meditation guru Michaiel Bovenes says: “When there is nowhere else to turn to, turn inwards. Equally wise words come from Rumi, an 18h century Persian poet, who said: “Silence is the language of God. All else is poor translation.” These great gurus are saying that only when the mind attains solitude that the truth is revealed. The Buddha is and exemplary model of this. After all, the Buddha attained Nirvana (in complete silence) through introspection, contemplation and meditation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the answer to what we seek in search of inner peace and happiness does not necessarily come from the intellect which is confined by space and time. Perhaps it comes from stillness. It must be then true what the great sages say that silence expands the mind and liberates it. I am also told that the universe is within me.  That the awesome and wonderous beauty of life emerges from within us. The DNA (Divine Nature of Awareness) is embedded in each and everyone of us and we need only tap its infinite potential through prayer, self-reflection, introspection, contemplation and meditation. Rumi says:” We carry inside us the wonder we seek outside us. I looked in temples, churches and mosques, but I found the divine within my heart.” To summarise, to find who we are, each of us have to take the step inwards for therein lies the universe that we are all seeking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially I found it very abstract but as I ponder deeper, I am able to see glimpses of light that shed some focus on the journey of self-realisation that I have undertaken. I have started the journey and am eager to see where it is going to take me. I would like to conclude with two profound sayings that encapsulate my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote-by-ramana-maharshi&#34;&gt;Quote by Ramana Maharshi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;When we turn the mind inwards, God manifests as the inner consciousness&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote-by-sri-sathya-sai-baba&#34;&gt;Quote by Sri Sathya Sai Baba&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The light of the Divine is within you&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Service of Love</title>
        <link>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/service-of-love/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/service-of-love/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/service-of-love/service_of_love_4.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Service of Love" /&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-doing-service-is-important-to-you-how-does-the-seva-improve-you-as-a-person-as-a-spiritual-aspirant-as-a-guru&#34;&gt;Why doing service is important to you? How does the seva improve you as a person as a spiritual aspirant as a guru?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I don’t know that seva means performing without expecting a reward, or a result of an outcome. Little I know that Seva is a powerful tool to learn about myself, be it inner or outer. I was doing it for my grandmother, father, mom, siblings, and my school teachers continuously since I was a little girl. Then Swami emerged into my life from a partially closed door to an opened door. He further enhanced me that there’s no greater service than service to mankind. Hence performing service. Nar Seva, Narayan Seva has become part and parcel of my life and I’ve totally lost in it.  I’m here for a reason and the reason is to render my service to mankind which is my utmost priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;quote-by-mahatma-ghandhi&#34;&gt;Quote by Mahatma Ghandhi&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Service is meant to pursuit one&amp;rsquo;s own interests for the betterment of oneself and as a collective gain. And it is considered the most important part of any spiritual practice. I remind myself, If I love my guru then I must show it by doing seva with love and compassion. There are many types of services one can perform either as a volunteer to feed the poor and the needy, being a counselor, a doctor, a nurse, or a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I choose to be a Balvikas Guru simply because teaching is my passion. Baba said, being a Guru is a noble profession. Filling a child&amp;rsquo;s mind at a tender age with holy and sacred thoughts guarantees a better person in the future. I believe Swami has given me this beautiful opportunity of nurturing and shaping of the younger generation. I enjoy teaching kids tremendously because they bring a lot of joy to me and I make sure I give and prepare all the opportunities for them to enjoy their childhood wholesomely and make a difference in a child&amp;rsquo;s life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important part is doing seva as a Balvikas guru certainly without any doubts transformed me to be a better person. By drawing a lesson based on values allows me to learn more of myself and what I need to do for my transformation and how I can set a good example for others. Conducting and running the class gives me the chance to be associated with Swami. The time spent during the class opens me up to God, reminds me of His existence and His Wonders in this world. Hence, I never forget to thank and appreciate Him for this birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, as a Balvikas Guru, I feel I&amp;rsquo;m staying connected with His presence because the children in the class indirectly teach and infect me with their pure love. Their singing of Bhajans and Sketches gives me a sense of pleasure and not forgetting the moral values that I too learn along with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last but not the end, I thank Swami for I&amp;rsquo;m the chosen one in his Vision and Mission. Thanking him again for the opportunity to be his instrument to transform the society but also for me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Why Baba Chose Parthi</title>
        <link>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-parthi/</link>
        <pubDate>Sat, 24 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
        
        <guid>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-parthi/</guid>
        <description>&lt;img src="http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-parthi/puttaparthi.jpg" alt="Featured image of post Why Baba Chose Parthi" /&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some insights into different words/names related to Swami’s place in India and its significance to us as His devotees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bharatha (India) → Bha + Ra+ Tha → feeling (bhava) – tune (raga) – rhythm (taala).
Anantapur (city in Andhra Pradesh) → Ananta = infinite, pur = body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A devotee should have staunch faith like the Mountain Penukonda (mount/fort in Anantapur city) –&amp;gt; Penu means big, konda means mountain. Therefore, our faith should be like a big mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to see God, we need to speak the truth. If we want to experience God, we should tread along the path of righteousness (Dharma). Dharmavaram (a city in Anantapur district) -&amp;gt; centre of Dharma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puttaparthi → putta means anthill. Anthills have had numerous significance in our puranas. The author of Ramayana, Valmiki got immersed in a huge pile of sand (anthill) as he took severe penance.  Lord Shiva has snakes around his neck. The snakes live in anthills. Lord Muruga is also associated with anthills (putta). Lord Venkateswara stayed in an anthill for a long time drinking the milk from the udder of a cow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are the reasons why Baba chose Puttaparthi.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;When I sing the Glory of Swami, I will think of Him residing in my heart. I feel that He is listening to me singing happily. It also gives me the pleasure humming His names. I hope Baba will enjoy listening to me singing. This is my way of showing my love towards Him. Sai Ram&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I learned this song in my Balvikas. The meaning of this song is O mind, worship the Lotus Feet of your God and Supreme Teacher, Sai Baba who will take you safely across the ocean of Samsara. Victory to our Lord and supreme Teacher, Sai Nath! To chant and worship the divine names of Lord Shiva who dwells on the Arunachala mountain and Sai Baba whose form is OM. Lastly, the reason why I like to sing this song is because it is very meaningful and Swami sang when he was 14 years old. This song reminds me of Swami and all the gurus who taught me this song. Thank you and Sairam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the &lt;a class=&#34;link&#34; href=&#34;https://practicalphilosophy.org.au/extras/mada-lasa/&#34;  target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;
    &gt;Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa&lt;/a&gt;. The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā&amp;rsquo;s newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
