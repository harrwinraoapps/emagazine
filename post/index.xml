      <description> This art was inspired by the weekly bhajans in our Sai centre. Small toy human sculptures were portrayed as devotees in a bhajan hall. Some traditional Indian musical instruments were sculptured as well. Small details were added as decorations. Swami’s portrait was placed in the middle.

No pen can ever explain the divine love, The feeling I am trying to explain Yet all creations cannot seem to stop talking about it. You taught us love You showered us with love, I learned that love, I showed that love. &#34;All things are beautiful seen through the eyes of love&#34; you said, That&#39;s when I knew I was beautiful.</description>

      <title>Why fear when I am here?</title>

      <description>Bhagawan says, &amp;ldquo;Why fear when I am here&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Fear&amp;rdquo; means fear of anything, imaginary or real, danger, disaster, or death. &amp;ldquo;When&amp;rdquo; means anytime, or all the time. &amp;ldquo;I am here&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;I am everywhere, I AM IN YOU and not outside you, not separate from you, wherever I am; in Prashanthi Nilayam, Brindavan or anywhere else.
In conclusion, we have no reason to fear as we have the Lord in our midst and have Him placed in our hearts.</description>

      <title>Bhajans &amp; Discipline</title>
      <link>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/bhajans-and-discipline/</link>

      <description>Bhajan is not merely an activity done for fun. Yes, it is a lot of fun to sing and be involved in bhajans, but at the same time it is a form of sadhana, a spiritual practice and even a form of Seva as the duty of a bhajan singer is to invoke devotion in oneself and others. Therefore, having said that, this means that discipline forms an integral part of the responsibility of a bhajan singer.</description>

      <title>Devotion Begins With Love</title>

      <description>Both the above songs are dedicated to Swamiji to show my gratitude and love towards Him. The first song is known as &amp;ldquo;Ragupatthi Ragava Raja Ram&amp;rdquo; which talks about Lord Rama and His selfless love to people around him. I have dedicated this song to Swamiji as I personally feel both of them have the same characteristics. I have read many stories about Swamiji and realized His selfless love towards His devotee around Him.</description>

      <description>Gayatri has 3 important aspects: Gayatri, Savitri and Saraswathi. What are these three? What do they signify?
The 1st Gayatri – Gaya means limbs of the body, the senses of the body. Gayatri means that which will take care of the effective functioning and well being of the body and senses. Gayatri means that the well-being of the body will be taken care of. Health is guaranteed. It is very important to have a sound mind in a sound body.</description>

      <title>My Parthi Experience</title>

      <description>My journey with Swami started when I was 7 years old. My neighbour who was also my tuition teacher at that time had introduced Swami to me. At that time, I was too young to realise His guidance and was just fascinated hearing a lot of stories about Puttaparthi.
How it will be?
After over 40 years, finally the day came on 24th Jan 2020, Friday, when I attended my first evening Bhajan in Prasanthi Nilayam, Puttaparthi.</description>

      <description>The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.
In this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā&amp;rsquo;s newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.</description>

      <title>The Life Story Of Baba</title>
      <link>http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/swami-life-story/</link>

      <description>I compiled an article about Swami&amp;rsquo;s Life story. I got the information to do the article in a few books and through internet search Google. This message is very important for me because so many people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the life story of Swami so I wanted everyone to know the story of Swami.
November 23, 1926, is a red-lettered day in the history of mankind. On that day was born in the obscure village of Puttaparthi, a charming baby boy in the Ratnakara family.</description>
