      <description>Let’s get to the point – we all know that spirituality is a practical journey of life towards Him, our Creator. A journey of life is unique to everyone – think about it, is there only ONE way to reach Him?
The whole idea of reaching God involves a myriad of angles – ranging from the complexity of meditation to the simplicity of Bhajans.
The practical teachings of Sai and Hinduism in general allows the participation of every individual from any walks of life, religion, culture, ethnicity, and language.</description>

      <description>Sairam, My name is Thareni and I am 16 years old. The title of my song offering is Bada Chittha Chora Brindavana Sanchara. I learned this song in my Balvikas. The meaning of this song talks about the greatest stealer of hearts who roams through Brindavan - Lord Krishna. The song talks about Lord Krishna as the child who plays the flute and who lifted the Govardhana Hill. He is also referred to as the cowherd boy who captivated the minds of His devotees.</description>

      <description> This art was inspired by the weekly bhajans in our Sai centre. Small toy human sculptures were portrayed as devotees in a bhajan hall. Some traditional Indian musical instruments were sculptured as well. Small details were added as decorations. Swami’s portrait was placed in the middle.

      <description>Bhajan is not merely an activity done for fun. Yes, it is a lot of fun to sing and be involved in bhajans, but at the same time it is a form of sadhana, a spiritual practice and even a form of Seva as the duty of a bhajan singer is to invoke devotion in oneself and others. Therefore, having said that, this means that discipline forms an integral part of the responsibility of a bhajan singer.</description>

      <description>Both the above songs are dedicated to Swamiji to show my gratitude and love towards Him. The first song is known as &amp;ldquo;Ragupathi Ragava Raja Ram&amp;rdquo; which talks about Lord Rama and His selfless love to people around him. I have dedicated this song to Swamiji as I personally feel both of them have the same characteristics. I have read many stories about Swamiji and realized His selfless love towards His devotee around Him.</description>

      <description>The Gita Samarpanam is to be an offering to Bhagawan on Ladies Day for the year 2020.
I grabbed this opportunity to be a part of the sadhana not only as an offering but more importantly to learn to chant the verses. Having tried unsuccessfully and intimidated by the Sanskrit verses, I had given up learning the Bhagavad Gita altogether. Now, with this opportunity, I had it all beautifully planned and laid out smoothly for me, right in the comfort of my home.</description>

As she went on preparing for the tea party, she was in a hurry to make it the perfect party. However, her house was in a mess and she was upset.
At that moment, her friend Arjun was cycling past her house.</description>

      <description>Amidst the widespread of Covid-19 we have all been lifted into another way of living. Our lives have been slowed down by an amazingly small organism with a huge amount of power. In March 2020, when the Movement Control Order was announced, there was sudden fear and panic everywhere.
Each day presented us with a new set of rules and changes that gave us a reason to pause. Schools closing, kids zoning out during endless Zoom classes, holiday plans cancelled.</description>

      <description>This story tells that two friends were walking through a desert. During some point of the journey they had an argument, and one friend slapped the other one in the face.The one who got slapped was hurt, but without saying anything, wrote in the sand
 &amp;ldquo;Today my best friend slapped me.&amp;rdquo;
 They kept on walking until they found an oasis, where they decided to take a bath. The one who had been slapped got stuck in the mire and started drowning, but the friend saved him.</description>

      <description>This artwork reflects the Human Values that I have learnt from my weekly Balvikas and bhajan class in centre / online classes. It makes me to be self-disciplined. I also remember that Swami said to practice &amp;ldquo;Truth, Honesty and Fairness&amp;rdquo;. I also learned meditation so that I can keep myself happy. I am always reminded of Swami&amp;rsquo;s saying - &amp;ldquo;I am always with you, in you, above you and around you&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Sis Jothi Bhai, New Zealand
 True. Only yesterday I was sharing that the &amp;lsquo;intensity of closeness&amp;rsquo; to Swami is felt now more during this Pandemic. More opportunities to go within.
 Sis Veni, Malaysia (Klang)
 Yeah, this pandemic gives us more time to approach Swami and bonding with family, nature and friends.
 Sis Shamani Nadaraja, Malaysia (Klang)
 I have learnt to spend quality time with family doing great things for myself and not forgetting the new friends from the nature.</description>

      <description>Swami simplifies our understanding of the principle of love with a saying: &amp;ldquo;Love in thought is Sathya, Love in action is Dharma, Love in feeling is Shanti and Love in understanding is Ahimsa&amp;rdquo;. Love is the hidden current for all the human values. When we speak with love, it is Sathya. When work is saturated with love, it is Dharma. Life lived according to these values gives peace. Love coming from a peaceful heart brings bliss.</description>

      <description>In every action we do, there are always two aspects to it – effort and result. The effort is always in our hands but more often than not the results aren’t. It is, however, in Swami’s hands. Therefore, it makes sense for us to focus all of our energy and time giving our best in the effort rather than focusing our time and energy on the outcome/results.
This thought then brings me to wonder how much effort is enough when we do something for Swami.</description>

Victory to our Lord and supreme Teacher, Sai Nath! To chant and worship the divine names of Lord Shiva who dwells on the Arunachala mountain and Sai Baba whose form is OM.</description>

      <description>My journey with Swami started when I was 7 years old. My neighbour who was also my tuition teacher at that time had introduced Swami to me. At that time, I was too young to realise His guidance and was just fascinated hearing a lot of stories about Puttaparthi.
How it will be?
After over 40 years, finally the day came on 24th Jan 2020, Friday, when I attended my first evening Bhajan in Prasanthi Nilayam, Puttaparthi.</description>

      <description>We need to respect nature and living things because the environment is important. I know that hurting the environment in various ways impacts all beings and pollutes the Earth in the long run. Without plants and trees we would not be able to survive. The environment is also good and healthy for us. It helps us to live in the way we please.
Nature is the most important thing in our lives and everyone should know about its importance.</description>

      <description>Oceans cover 71% of the planet and are home to important species and ecosystems that we rely on for food, livelihoods, climate regulation and more. But the oceans need our help. Saving the oceans can sometimes feel like an overwhelming task, but if we all pitch in, we can make a big difference.
We can save the ocean by practising the following habits:
 Conserve Water. Use less water so excess runoff and wastewater will not flow into the ocean.</description>

I decided that it was a great opportunity to take a breather from the hectic pace of life that I had become accustomed to. Rather than dwelling on the negativity and worrying unnecessarily over a virus that was restricting our way of life, I decided to make the most of the situation as best I could.</description>

      <description>Bhagwan Himself narrates a glimpse of amazing miracles towards mankind which is beyond one’s explanations. To comprehend Baba’s significant signs of wonders, we must delve faithfully to understand His glory and experience the element of divinity. The approach of love and affection that He showers upon all, is purely divine and magical. In a discourse on December 1976, He said that His manifestations were not to deceive and mislead the people but to attract, reconstruct, transform, and make them useful and serviceable for society.</description>

      <description>One day, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati had a disagreement. She disappeared and said she would like to see how the world would survive without her.
In the disappearance of Goddess Parvati, the whole world was begging for food. To find a solution, Lord Shiva went to Kashi. There in Kashi, He saw Goddess Parvati in the form of Goddess Annapoorani (an aspect of Devi and is known as the goddess of food and nourishment) distributing food.</description>

 This photo has many meaningful messages. It gives us an opportunity to ponder on all those moments Swami was there to protect, guard and guide us. I have personally experienced Swami and His love in many ways. It’s so true He is there in all situations. Come let’s share His love with all which will bring us closer to Him.

      <description>Here is a story of Lord Vishnu. There was a time when the Devas (Lords) and Asuras (demons) were churning the ocean. Eventually, they derived the sweet nectar of immortality, the Amritham. Along with the Amritham, came a beautiful maiden. She was none other than Goddess Lakshmi.
Goddess Lakshmi saw Mahavishnu in Indraloka and married Him. He became Shreenatha, the beloved of fortune. Lord Vishnu placed the symbol of Goddess Lakshmi on His chest.</description>

      <description>The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.
In this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā&amp;rsquo;s newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.</description>

      <description>I compiled an article about Swami&amp;rsquo;s Life story. I got the information to do the article in a few books and through internet search Google. This message is very important for me because so many people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the life story of Swami so I wanted everyone to know the story of Swami.
November 23, 1926, is a red-lettered day in the history of mankind. On that day was born in the obscure village of Puttaparthi, a charming baby boy in the Ratnakara family.</description>

      <description>Vijay and Raju were friends. On a holiday they went walking into a forest, enjoying the beauty of nature. Suddenly they saw a bear coming at them. They became frightened.
Raju, who knew all about climbing trees, ran up to a tree and climbed up quickly. He didn’t think of Vijay. Vijay had no idea how to climb a tree. Vijay thought for a second. He has heard before that animals don’t prefer to eat dead bodies, so he fell to the ground and held his breath.</description>

      <description>Below are some insights into different words/names related to Swami’s place in India and its significance to us as His devotees.
 Bharatha (India) → Bha + Ra+ Tha → feeling (bhava) – tune (raga) – rhythm (taala). Anantapur (city in Andhra Pradesh) → Ananta = infinite, pur = body.
 A devotee should have staunch faith like the Mountain Penukonda (mount/fort in Anantapur city) –&amp;gt; Penu means big, konda means mountain.</description>

      <title>Why fear when I am here?</title>
      <link>https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/quote/</link>

      <description>Bhagawan says, &amp;ldquo;Why fear when I am here&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Fear&amp;rdquo; means fear of anything, imaginary or real, danger, disaster, or death. &amp;ldquo;When&amp;rdquo; means anytime, or all the time. &amp;ldquo;I am here&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;I am everywhere, I AM IN YOU and not outside you, not separate from you, wherever I am; in Prashanthi Nilayam, Brindavan or anywhere else.
In conclusion, we have no reason to fear as we have the Lord in our midst and have Him placed in our hearts.</description>
