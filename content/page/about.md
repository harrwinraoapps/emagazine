## Foreword

Dear Reader,

Greetings to you!!

We are pleased to present to you the 1st edition of the SSBCBK eMagazine : The Awakening. Enjoy every moment reading it because in life there aren’t rewinds, only flashbacks. We have for you, from various age groups, a wide range of poems, bhajans, drawings, paintings, and some informative and inspirational articles. We are proud to say that The Awakening features articles by enthusiastic writers accompanied by great photos, videos and illustrations on a variety of subjects of interest on Swami’s teachings.

Isn’t it rightly said, “A flower makes no garland.” Thus, The Awakening is not the outcome of the effort put in by an individual, but is the immense effort put forward by, our SSBCBK Editorial Team, Balvikas Gurus, Parents, and our dear Balvikas Children. Wish to thank the SSBCBK Editorial Team for a wonderful initiative in showcasing the hidden talents and also enhancing the bond among the SAI fraternity of Bandar Klang. 

We apologize for shortcomings, if any and welcome your feedback. Hope you will cherish our efforts.\
Happy reading!

Ramanathan,\
Chairman of SSBCBK
