Gayatri has 3 important aspects: Gayatri, Savitri and Saraswathi. What are these three? What do they signify?

The 1st Gayatri – Gaya means limbs of the body, the senses of the body. Gayatri means that which will take care of the effective functioning and well being of the body and senses. Gayatri means that the well-being of the body will be taken care of. Health is guaranteed. It is very important to have a sound mind in a sound body. It begins with the body.  Any pursuit of learning in life begins with the body. This body is made of five elements.  Swami speaks of this body as materialisation. Materialisation is in one sense composed of five elements.

The 2nd aspect – Savitri stands for life principle. It is not good enough to have only a good body. The body works only because of the life principle. Life is a gift of God.  With money we can buy medicine, the aspect that is Savitri. Gayatri is the body – materialisation. Savitri is life – Swami calls it vibration, meaning the body has limbs but there should be vibration to make it work or move.

The 3rd aspect is Saraswathi – is the faculty of speech of words. It is emphasised that everything that is spoken should be the truth.  This truth is not ordinary or scientific truth. It is unchangeable, eternal and permanent, it is beyond time and space. Such a kind of truth is verbally spoken and is called the aspect of Saraswathi. Saraswathi is the source.  The truth is the source. The unknowable (beyond the limits of human experience or understanding), the unchangeable, the permanent, the eternal truth.  This is called radiation according to Swami. So, radiation is the source.  It is a thermal power station. It is the one out of which everything originates. So the central source of activity is the eternal truth. Saraswathi – radiation. This radiation at the operational level is the vibration – Savitri. This vibration which enters into our body makes our senses and limbs operate. So radiation leads to vibration and this vibration will make the body function effectively.

The body – materialisation – Gayatri (Bhur)

The life – vibration – Savitri (Bhuvah)

The truth – radiation – Saraswathi (Suwaha)
