## Why is doing service important to you? How does the seva improve you as a person, as a spiritual aspirant and as a guru?

Well, I don't know that seva means performing without expecting a reward, a result or an outcome. Little did I know that Seva is a powerful tool to learn about myself, be it my inner self or my outer self. I have been doing it for my grandmother, father, mom, siblings and my school teachers continuously since I was a little girl. Then, Swami emerged into my life from a partially closed door to an opened door. He further enhanced me to realise that there is no greater service than service to mankind. Hence performing service, 'Nara Seva, Narayan Seva' has become part and parcel of my life and I have become totally lost in it.  I'm here for a reason and the reason is to render my service to mankind which is my utmost priority.

Service is meant to pursue one's own interests for the betterment of oneself and as a collective gain. It is considered the most important part of any spiritual practice. I remind myself, if I love my guru then I must show it by doing seva with love and compassion. There are many types of services one can perform, either as a volunteer to feed the poor and the needy, being a counselor, a doctor, a nurse or a teacher. 

I chose to be a Balvikas Guru simply because teaching is my passion. Baba said, being a Guru is a noble profession. Filling a child's mind at a tender age with holy and sacred thoughts guarantees a better person in the future. I believe Swami has given me this beautiful opportunity of nurturing and shaping the younger generation. I enjoy teaching kids tremendously because they bring a lot of joy to me. I also ensure I give and prepare all the opportunities for them to enjoy their childhood wholesomely. I always try my best to make a difference in a child's life. 

The most important part is that by doing seva as a Balvikas guru, it certainly without a doubt, transformed me into a better person. By coming up with lesson plans based on values, it allowed me to learn more about myself. It also guided me on what I need to do for my self-transformation and how I can set a good example for others. Conducting and running these classes gives me the chance to be associated with Swami. The time spent during the class opens me up to God, reminds me of His existence and His wonders in this world. Hence, I never forget to thank and appreciate Him for this birth.

Furthermore, as a Balvikas Guru, I feel I am staying connected to His presence because the children in the class indirectly teach and infect me with their pure love. Their singing of bhajans and sketch performances gives me a sense of pleasure and not forgetting the moral values that I learn along with them.

Last but not the least, I thank Swami for I am the chosen one in his Vision and Mission. Thanking him again for the opportunity to be His instrument, to transform the society and also myself.
