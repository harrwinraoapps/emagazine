We need to respect nature and living things because the environment is important. I know that hurting the environment in various ways impacts all beings and pollutes the Earth in the long run. Without plants and trees we would not be able to survive. The environment is also good and healthy for us. It helps us to live in the way we please.

Nature is the most important thing in our lives and everyone should know about its importance. Everything we have now, we get it from nature. Everyone is blessed with the true love of good in the form of beautiful nature. Nature gives us relaxation and comfort, it motivates and inspires us.
