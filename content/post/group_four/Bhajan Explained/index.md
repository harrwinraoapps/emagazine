Sairam, My name is Thareni and I am 16 years old. The title of my song offering is Bada Chittha Chora Brindavana Sanchara. I learned this song in my Balvikas. The meaning of this song talks about the greatest stealer of hearts who roams through Brindavan - Lord Krishna. The song talks about Lord Krishna as the child who plays the flute and who lifted the Govardhana Hill. He is also referred to as the cowherd boy who captivated the minds of His devotees. Lastly, the reason why I like to sing this song is because it is very meaningful and also melodious. This song reminds me of Swami and all the gurus who taught me this song. Thank you and Sairam.
