<p>I am blessed <br />
With your love that makes me whole <br />
Your love that never takes a toll. <br />
No pen can ever explain the divine love, <br />
The feeling I am trying to explain <br />
Yet all creations cannot seem to stop talking about it. <br />
You taught us love <br />
You showered us with love, <br />
I learned that love, <br />
I showed that love. <br />
"All things are beautiful seen through the eyes of love" you said,  <br />
That's when I knew I was beautiful. <br />
"Love is the property of God" you said, <br />
Thatâ€™s when I knew I was investing. <br />
"When you have ego, I-go" you said, <br />
That's when I let ego go. <br />
Dearest Sai, <br />
Bless me, <br />
To give the same love that never takes a toll.</p>
