{{< quote >}}
I am blessed
With your love that makes me whole
Your love that never takes a toll.
No pen can ever explain the divine love,
The feeling I am trying to explain
Yet all creations cannot seem to stop talking about it.
You taught us love
You showered us with love,
I learned that love,
I showed that love.
"All things are beautiful seen through the eyes of love" you said, 
That's when I knew I was beautiful.
"Love is the property of God" you said,
Thatâ€™s when I knew I was investing.
"When you have ego, I-go" you said,
That's when I let ego go.
Dearest Sai,
Bless me,
To give the same love that never takes a toll.
