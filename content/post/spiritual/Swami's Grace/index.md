This photo has many meaningful messages. It gives us an opportunity to ponder on all those moments Swami was there to protect, guard and guide us. I have personally experienced Swami and His love in many ways. It’s so true He is there in all situations. Come let’s share His love with all which will bring us closer to Him.

> Sis Jothi Bhai, New Zealand

The Lord responds when you call out to Him earnestly with love. This is Passionate Divine Love. One day whilst I was on my walk, I had the strong yearning to see Swami in His physical form. Mentally I was calling out for Him and before I could get a response I said, "I know Swami you will say you are in the breeze, in the leaves rustling, in the birds chirping, in the blue sky", etc. 

And my response was, "Yes, I know You are in all these forms, so what's wrong if I yearn to see Your physical form". This intense Love was so strong that, that night itself Swami manifested in my dream and gave me such long darshan and padanamaskar.

I am convinced that The Lord responds according to our intensity of devotion.

When I saw a posting of this picture, I felt all the more grateful and really thank Swami from the bottom of my heart for all the times that I felt His presence and love in my hour of need. What more can I ask when God himself is holding the umbrella! Thank you & LOVE you Swami.

What a wonderful depiction of Swami holding the umbrella of grace and reaching out to help the one in need. Never let go of my hands is the loud and clear message here. My journey with Sai has truly being from darkness to light. Swami famous quote "Take one step towards Me and I will take a hundred steps towards you" has been my guide and reminder in carrying out all my duties. Keep Swami close to your heart and He will protect you and keep you safe in all adversities. Keep chanting the Gayathri Mantra as adviced by Swami at all times for it has immense power in transforming and enlightening our intellect. I pray that Swami's grace and blessings will forever be with all of us. Jai Sai Ram.

> Sis Nirmala Devi, Malaysia (Klang)

This picture depicts our faith in Swami. Are we ready to surrender our problems and challenges to Him when we know absolutely that He is ready out there to give us protection and shelter? We still want things to work out our way isn't it?  Let's learn to surrender and have not 100%, but 200% faith in Him. Love you dearest Swami.

> Sis Dolly Indra Devi, Malaysia (Klang)

To have Swami in your life is a greatest blessing. Every single problem you face, every difficult situation you are in, by putting your palms together in union with Swami, you feel all is lessened. The umbrella that Swami is holding says a thousand words. Come my child, I'll shield you from all your difficulties. This is my personal experience with Swami. God is in the form of love in every human being. May Swami's blessings and grace be forever showered on all of us. Jai Sai Ram.
