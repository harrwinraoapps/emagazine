What is SSS? For those avid readers of SAI literature, what pops up in our mind is Swami’s literature titled  ‘Sathya Sai Speaks’. Sorry, it’s not. It’s in fact a collection of my observations and my metaphoric interpretation of these to daily life. These incidents occurred during my early morning walks at the Klang stadium where I chance upon something and given the years of association with SAI, His teachings, His devotees and research for Balvikas material, a different perspective crops up to my observations. These occur predominantly at the Stadium and definitely in SAI’s presence, so I named them as **“SAI’s Satsangh @ Stadium”** thus, **SSS**.   

### Observation:

You may have a perfect vision without the need for glasses and may also be considered to have sharp observation skills with ability to spot minute details.  But can you spot a strain of a spider’s web on a tree branch about 20 feet above? Normally you can’t due to the size and distance of the object. If you do, then naturally you will thump you chest for having such keen observation skills or perfect vision. 

However, I was able to (not due to my perfect vision, as I use reading glasses) but due to nature’s assistance. When I looked up, there was a gentle breeze and the clouds had just parted to allow the sun’s rays to pass through, which caused a single strand of a spider’s web to glisten against the sky, revealing the web and the spider. To my surprise, even the shrubs in front of me had spider web strands between them that were shimmering and fluttering in the wind. I had never seen these before. 

### Lesson: 

No matter how competent or capable you are, you should always attribute your success to God’s (in this case nature) assistance and grace. HIS grace to ensure all elements and circumstances are in sync is a catalyst for your success. In this case, if not for the sun’s rays peeping through the departing clouds and the wind which made the web flutter and shine, (all of which are God’s elements), I would have missed it. Hence, the egoistic notion that it is solely due to your expertise and capabilities should be eliminated. Further analogies to this lesson are as follows:-

Arjuna’s thumping of his chest and claiming that he killed Karna in the Kurukshetra war can be compared to this. Without Krishna’s leelas and the various happenings in Karna’s life, which weakened the latter, Karna would not have been so easily vanquished.   

Likewise, you could have scored multiple ‘A’s’ in our school exams, and excelled in your College/University, obtaining tertiary qualifications, which are still a dream for some. You may get a job in a reputable company and get promotions one after another and quickly move up to a high and respectable position. It’s natural to look back and feel that all these achievements are due to your acumen, expertise, hard work, dedication etc., etc. 

Yes! You are right but, it’s not your effort only, definitely! There is a hidden force that has enabled and facilitated all this to happen. This Universal force was guiding you through your parents, friends, colleagues, peers and also ensured the right environment, good health (at crucial moments) and frame of mind. Thus, we must always be aware of this unseen hand that’s guiding us.  

This made me reflect and be thankful to this omnipresent companion, for what I am today. It may sound cliché but A.R.Rahman summed it up beautifully with “Ella Pughallum Iraivanuke” (all praises belong to the Lord).
