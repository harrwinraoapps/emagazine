Music has always been my passion and the means through which I connect to the Lord. This is a simple offering to render my love to Swami through the first bhajan that He introduced to His devotees.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Meaning:</span>
O mind! Meditate on the Lotus Feet of the Lord. That will take you safely across the ocean of life and death. Glory to the supreme guru, Lord Sathya Sai. Chant ‘Om Namah Shivaya’. Chant the name of Lord Shiva, the One who resides in Arunachala. Bow to Sai Baba who is Om personified.
