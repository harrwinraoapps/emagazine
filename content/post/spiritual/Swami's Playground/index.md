I completely have the FAITH in Swami and his unconditional LOVE.. share with us your experience too.

> Sis Shamani Nadaraja, Malaysia (Klang)

This happen to me end of last year. When my previouse partner came to conclusion to sell her share in the bisness i got scared but putting all faith in swami i took my share back and stop from her.. One month i was just at home all by myself asking swami to guide and the best he made me to choose a part all by myself and today due to the pendamic the tadika has close shop but i am safe in his arm protected. My virtual and personal tutoring venture had made me grow safe in this pendemic. Thanks to swami for giving me that shake in the begining for not i have fall now.
