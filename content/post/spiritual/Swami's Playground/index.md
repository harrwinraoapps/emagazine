Swamiâ€™s Love... Live in Sai Love... There have been many moments in my life where I am this little girl in the playground with Swami... He is always there waiting to protect, guard and guide me .. I completely have the FAITH in Swami and his unconditional LOVE.. share with us your experience too.

> Sis Shamani Nadaraja, Malaysia (Klang)

This happened to me end of last year. When my previous business partner came to conclusion to sell her share in the busness i was scared but I put all faith in Swami. I took my share back. For one month I was just at home by myself asking Swami to guide the best way possible. Today due to the pandemic the tadika has closed but i am safe in his arm protected. My virtual and personal tutoring venture is growing safely in this pandemic. Thanks to Swami for giving me that shake in the beginning so I can stand now.
