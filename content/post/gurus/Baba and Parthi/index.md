Below are some insights into different words/names related to Swami’s place in India and its significance to us as His devotees. 

> Bharatha (India) → Bha + Ra+ Tha → feeling (bhava) – tune (raga) – rhythm (taala).
> Anantapur (city in Andhra Pradesh) → Ananta = infinite, pur = body.

A devotee should have staunch faith like the Mountain Penukonda (mount/fort in Anantapur city) –> Penu means big, konda means mountain. Therefore, our faith should be like a big mountain.

If we want to see God, we need to speak the truth. If we want to experience God, we should tread along the path of righteousness (Dharma). Dharmavaram (a city in Anantapur district) -> centre of Dharma. 

Puttaparthi → putta means anthill. Anthills have had numerous significance in our puranas. The author of Ramayana, Valmiki got immersed in a huge pile of sand (anthill) as he took severe penance.  Lord Shiva has snakes around his neck. The snakes live in anthills. Lord Muruga is also associated with anthills (putta). Lord Venkateswara stayed in an anthill for a long time drinking the milk from the udder of a cow. 

These are the reasons why Baba chose Puttaparthi.
