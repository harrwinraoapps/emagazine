In every action we do, there are always two aspects to it – effort and result. The effort is always in our hands but more often than not the results aren’t. It is, however, in Swami’s hands. Therefore, it makes sense for us to focus all of our energy and time giving our best in the effort rather than focusing our time and energy on the outcome/results.

This thought then brings me to wonder how much effort is enough when we do something for Swami. Is it not the love and sincerity that matters? 

Swami has said

{{< quote >}}
<p>"Duty without love is deplorable; <br />
Duty with love is desirable; <br />
Love without Duty is Divine."</p>
{{< /quote >}}

But then again how do we decide if our effort is enough? It is easy to justify our own actions by saying it is sufficient but how do we truly know if it is the best we can offer? 

As always when we have questions in our hearts and minds, Swami will send us the answer in some form or another. The answer to my questions came through an online Satsangh by Team Radio Sai called ‘Can Destiny be Overcome?

The first time I watched this satsangh session was in June 2020 but the message did not really hit me then. It was only when I watched it again sometime in October 2020 that the message in the session answered my questions. This just comes to show that (i) it is never a waste re-listening to Swami’s talks/discourses/satsanghs and (ii) Swami is always there to give us answers to our questions so long we look for it with an open mind.  

Swami says these two very beautiful quotes to summarise the answer on how we should perform our actions or carry out our duty. 
1. Kartavyam Yogam Ucyate (Performing One’s Duty is said to be Yoga) and 
2. Yogaha Karmasu Kaushalam (Excellence in Actions is Yoga). 

This basically drives the message that in whatever we are doing, we need to give our full attention and perform the task as perfectly as possible because at the end of the day every action we perform is an offering to God. Swami’s students from His Institutions have shared many experiences on how Swami’s eye for detail is immeasurable in any activity that he embarks upon. If this does not serve as motivation for me to give my best, then probably nothing else can motivate me further.  Below is a short video of a really cute incident that happened in Puttaparthi with a profound message from Swami on how we should strive for excellence in our actions.

The two key learnings that I got from the satsangh is as follows:
1. We should strive for excellence in our best possible manner. We should strive to be a better version of ourselves and to be better in the roles we play by improving ourselves. We should not strive for excellence by comparing ourselves with others and thinking that as long we are better than others, then that is excellence. We should strive to BETTER ourselves in whatever we do and offer our actions to Swami in every role we play whether it is at home, at work, in the community or in the Sai organization. By doing this we will become the best we can be in every aspect of life. 
2. After putting in our best efforts, we should then leave the results to Swami. Again, as Swami says, Karma Phala Tyaga (Renunciation of the Fruits of Action). We should not get too attached to the results because ultimately there are aspects that are beyond our control. We should be more process-oriented where we enjoy the process of performing the actions and not be result-oriented where we place our entire happiness in the outcome of the actions. God focuses on our actions and efforts, not the results; therefore, we should inculcate the same practice. 

With this, I sincerely pray to Swami to help me remember this whenever I perform my actions and carry out my duty. I should never settle for good enough or mediocrity especially when I am doing something for Swami and ultimately, I should reach a point where every action I perform is for Swami.
