The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the [Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa](https://practicalphilosophy.org.au/extras/mada-lasa/). The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.

In this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā's newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.

## Translation

{{< quote >}}
<p>Why are you crying? <br />
You are pure <br />
The name you have acquired is not yours, merely a mind-created fiction applied to you <br />
The body is not you, nor are you of it <br />
The Lord of the universe doesn't cry either! <br />
This sound is an illusion attributed to you <br />
The qualities imagined as yours are inherent in all the senses <br />
The insignificant elements within the man acquire the condition of growth through the addition of food, water and drink <br />
It is not a growth or diminution of You <br />
Within the body shell <br />
You remain constant <br />
Do not become confounded by this body which has been fastened upon you <br />
Father, Son, Mother, Wife, Mine, Not Mine <br />
Do not assign much significance to what is only an aggregation of elements <br />
The deluded man thinks pains alleviate pain <br />
The deluded man thinks enjoyment of pleasures gives happiness <br />
The intelligent man whose mind is free from confusion knows pleasures and sorrows to be alike <br />
The carriage goes upon the earth, the body is seated in the carriage <br />
The Self resides within the body <br />
The deluded Jiva thinks "I am this body" <br />
The Self has no attachement to His carriage <br />
Foolish is such ignorance! <br /></p>
