Diya is an eight-year-old cheerful girl, witty and loving. One day as Diya was playing, she thought to herself "Why don't I have a tea party with Swami? Swami will be delighted."  

As she went on preparing for the tea party, she was in a hurry to make it the perfect party. However, her house was in a mess and she was upset. 

At that moment, her friend Arjun was cycling past her house. Diya called out to Arjun and asked him if he could help her clean the house. Arjun agreed and started to help Diya.  

As time flew, the place was cleaned up and the tea party was ready. The tea had been made by her mother along with freshly baked cookies from the oven and Diya had changed into a beautiful pink dress. Diya thanked Arjun and told him that she was now waiting for Swami.

Hearing this, Arjun said, "Dear Diya, I am already here, don't you realize who I am?". At this point, Diya saw a lovely image of her beloved Swami on the face of Arjun and was amazed with the image she saw. She hadn't realised that Arjun was all along, her beloved Swami. "Oh Swami! I didn't realise it was YOU!  Swami replied, "Diya, I'm always in you, with you and around you, no matter what. Come let's have our tea now", said Swami and Diya smiled, so pleased.  

As she was having her tea, she heard a loud bell go off "Ringggggg....."

"Diya, Diya wake up. It's time for school". It was the sound of her mother waking her up. Diya woke up as the morning sun shone on her face along with its lovely breeze, as her mother drew the curtains open.  

At this point, Diya realised that her tea party with Swami was all but a dream. Remembering her dream, she broke into a beautiful smile, as she heard Swamiâ€™s words once again in her ears:

>"Diya I'm always in you, with you and around you, no matter what."
