Here is a story of Lord Vishnu. There was a time when the Devas (Lords) and Asuras (demons) were churning the ocean. Eventually, they derived the sweet nectar of immortality, the Amritham. Along with the Amritham, came a beautiful maiden. She was none other than Goddess Lakshmi.

Goddess Lakshmi saw Mahavishnu in Indraloka and married Him. He became Shreenatha, the beloved of fortune. Lord Vishnu placed the symbol of Goddess Lakshmi on His chest.
