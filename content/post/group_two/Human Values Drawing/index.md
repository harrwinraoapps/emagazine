This artwork reflects the Human Values that I have learnt from my weekly Balvikas and bhajan class in centre / online classes. It makes me to be self-disciplined. I also remember that Swami said to practice "Truth, Honesty and Fairness". I also learned meditation so that I can keep myself happy. I am always reminded of Swami's saying - "I am always with you, in you, above you and around you".
