Both the above songs are dedicated to Swamiji to show my gratitude and love towards Him. The first song is known as "Ragupathi Ragava Raja Ram"  which talks about Lord Rama and His selfless love to people around him. I have dedicated this song to Swamiji as I personally feel both of them have the same characteristics. I have read many stories about Swamiji and realized His selfless love towards His devotee around Him. He takes many different forms to help those who have surrendered to him.

Whereas, the second song is known as “Ra Ra Venugopala”. This song is to invite Swamiji into my life to guide me on following the righteous path to succeed in my life. Besides, I do take this opportunity to express my gratitude towards Swamiji who created this opportunity for me to participate in His 95th birthday event and demonstrate my musical talent. Thank you so much Swamiji.

I’ve been learning veenai since 2014. My first guru was Master Kabil Raj from KVSMA institute and I continued my learning with Kalamamani Sri Padmini from Sri Padmini Vidyalaya Institute from 2016 onwards. Teacher Padmini has taught me many different songs both on veenai and vocally. Thank you to my teacher for guiding me on this video. The reason for me to pursue my musical talent is my mom. My mom knows how to play veenai too and she has taught me some devotional songs since I was 10 years old. 

During rehearsals and recording sessions I have been facing many troubles and obstacles. Despite those problems, Swamiji’s love and blessings encouraged me to complete the recording successfully.
