Bhagawan says, "Why fear when I am here". "Fear" means fear of anything, imaginary or real, danger, disaster, or death. "When" means anytime, or all the time. "I am here" means "I am everywhere, I AM IN YOU and not outside you, not separate from you, wherever I am;  in Prashanthi Nilayam, Brindavan or anywhere else. 

In conclusion, we have no reason to fear as we have the Lord in our midst and have Him placed in our hearts. All we need to do is LOVE HIM dearly. We belong to Bhagawan, we are special indeed. We are one big, sweet, loving SAI family.
