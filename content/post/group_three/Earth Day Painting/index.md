A mountain landscape art work which was inspired by one of my idol’s painting from a reality show which I watched recently. The quote, “Nature is the art of God” was added to show that we should protect and love our nature wholeheartedly. Happy
Earth Day to everyone who lives in our beloved God’s green earth.
