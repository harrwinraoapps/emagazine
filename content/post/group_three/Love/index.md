Swami’s life is His message and His message is love. Love is the basis of human life. 

If we see the world with love, it would be filled with positivity. When we live our lives with love, our lives get purified. We start seeing the good in everyone and put the negativity behind us. This is something that is very important especially in this generation. Love is pure and unconditional when it comes purely from the heart. 

“God is love; live in love”. God, who is the embodiment of love, can only be experienced through love. Love directed towards God is pure, unconditional and selfless. Devotion signifies love. Love for the divine is the only true form of love. Swami is truly the incarnation of love. When one is filled with love, the other four human values - truth, non-violence, peace and right conduct, would also be attained. 

One should be prepared to sacrifice for a loved one. That is true love. Only when we “live in love”, can we fully understand the true nature of love. Saying the words, “ I love you” is very common but whether we say it from the bottom of our hearts is what matters. 

Swami has taught us to spread love to everyone, every living being. When we spread love, we also receive love in return. Spreading love also spreads happiness and joy, it makes everyone happy. Love can change the way we see people or things. Love changes it in a positive way, to always see the good side. 

With love, our lives would be content and filled with positivity.  We will always see the good in others and we, ourselves, will never judge a person. One should never judge a person because everyone is different and they shouldn’t be judged for being themselves. Love all, don’t spread hate. Be kind to everyone and love everyone. Don’t forget to love yourself too because before you can show love to anyone else, make sure that you love yourself first.
