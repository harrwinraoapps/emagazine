      <description>Bhagawan says, &amp;ldquo;Why fear when I am here&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Fear&amp;rdquo; means fear of anything, imaginary or real, danger, disaster, or death. &amp;ldquo;When&amp;rdquo; means anytime, or all the time. &amp;ldquo;I am here&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;I am everywhere, I AM IN YOU and not outside you, not separate from you, wherever I am; in Prashanthi Nilayam, Brindavan or anywhere else.
In conclusion, we have no reason to fear as we have the Lord in our midst and have Him placed in our hearts.</description>

      <title>Devotion Begins With Love</title>

      <description>Both the above songs are dedicated to Swamiji to show my gratitude and love towards Him. The first song is known as &amp;ldquo;Ragupatthi Ragava Raja Ram&amp;rdquo; which talks about Lord Rama and His selfless love to people around him. I have dedicated this song to Swamiji as I personally feel both of them have the same characteristics. I have read many stories about Swamiji and realized His selfless love towards His devotee around Him.</description>

      <description> The background painting was inspired by pastel blue and pink aesthetics. A 95th birthday wish to Baba was lettered in calligraphic font. Some of Swamiâ€™s incredible quotes were written as well. Some details and decorations were added too.

      <title>The Life Story Of Baba</title>

      <description>I compiled an article about Swami&amp;rsquo;s Life story. I got the information to do the article in a few books and through internet search Google. This message is very important for me because so many people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the life story of Swami so I wanted everyone to know the story of Swami.
November 23, 1926, is a red-lettered day in the history of mankind. On that day was born in the obscure village of Puttaparthi, a charming baby boy in the Ratnakara family.</description>
