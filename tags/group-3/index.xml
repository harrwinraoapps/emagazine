      <description>When I sing the glory of Swami, I will think of Him residing in my heart. I feel that He is listening to me singing happily. Humming His name also gives me pleasure. I hope Baba will enjoy listening to me singing this song. This is my way of showing my love towards Him. Sai Ram.

      <description>I learned this song in my Balvikas.
The meaning of this song is: O mind, worship the Lotus Feet of your God and Supreme Teacher, Sai Baba who will take you safely across the ocean of Samsara. Victory to our Lord and supreme Teacher, Sai Nath! To chant and worship the divine names of Lord Shiva who dwells on the Arunachala mountain and Sai Baba whose form is OM.</description>

      <title>Why fear when I am here?</title>
      <link>https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/quote/</link>

      <description>Bhagawan says, &amp;ldquo;Why fear when I am here&amp;rdquo;. &amp;ldquo;Fear&amp;rdquo; means fear of anything, imaginary or real, danger, disaster, or death. &amp;ldquo;When&amp;rdquo; means anytime, or all the time. &amp;ldquo;I am here&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;I am everywhere, I AM IN YOU and not outside you, not separate from you, wherever I am; in Prashanthi Nilayam, Brindavan or anywhere else.
In conclusion, we have no reason to fear as we have the Lord in our midst and have Him placed in our hearts.</description>

      <description> The name of the songs are Akhanda Jyothi Jalao and Ek Baar Kshama karo sai . I sang this song because it has a special place in my heart. The meaning of this song is very heart warming and sweet. I learnt this song from the Centre Bhajan Singers.

      <title>Devotion Begins With Love</title>

      <description>Both the above songs are dedicated to Swamiji to show my gratitude and love towards Him. The first song is known as &amp;ldquo;Ragupatthi Ragava Raja Ram&amp;rdquo; which talks about Lord Rama and His selfless love to people around him. I have dedicated this song to Swamiji as I personally feel both of them have the same characteristics. I have read many stories about Swamiji and realized His selfless love towards His devotee around Him.</description>

      <description>Start the day with love; Fill the day with love; Spend the day with love; End the day with love; This is the way to God. div.quote{font-style: italic; text-align:center;margin-top: auto;margin-bottom: auto;margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;} Swami’s life is His message and His message is love. Love is the basis of human life.
If we see the world with love, it would be filled with positivity.</description>

      <title>LOVE = HAPPINESS</title>

      <description>Swami simplifies our understanding of the principle of love with a saying: &amp;ldquo;Love in thought is Sathya, Love in action is Dharma, Love in feeling is Shanti and Love in understanding is Ahimsa&amp;rdquo;. Love is the hidden current for all the human values. When we speak with love, it is Sathya. When work is saturated with love, it is Dharma. Life lived according to these values gives peace. Love coming from a peaceful heart brings bliss.</description>

      <description> The background painting was inspired by pastel blue and pink aesthetics. A 95th birthday wish to Baba was lettered in calligraphic font. Some of Swami’s incredible quotes were written as well. Some details and decorations were added too.

      <title>Signs &amp; Wonders Of Sathya Sai</title>
      <link>https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/signs-wonders/</link>

      <description>Bhagwan Himself narrates a glimpse of amazing miracles towards mankind which is beyond one’s explanations. To comprehend Baba’s significant signs of wonders, we must delve faithfully to understand His glory and experience the element of divinity. The approach of love and affection that He showers upon all, is purely divine and magical. In a discourse on December 1976, He said that His manifestations were not to deceive and mislead the people but to attract, reconstruct, transform, and make them useful and serviceable for society.</description>

      <title>The Life Story Of Baba</title>
      <link>https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/swami-life-story/</link>

      <guid>https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/swami-life-story/</guid>
      <description>I compiled an article about Swami&amp;rsquo;s Life story. I got the information to do the article in a few books and through internet search Google. This message is very important for me because so many people don&amp;rsquo;t know about the life story of Swami so I wanted everyone to know the story of Swami.
November 23, 1926, is a red-lettered day in the history of mankind. On that day was born in the obscure village of Puttaparthi, a charming baby boy in the Ratnakara family.</description>
