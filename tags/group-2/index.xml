      <description>This artwork reflects the Human Values that I have learnt from my weekly Balvikas and bhajan class in centre / online classes. It makes me to be self-disciplined. I also remember that Swami said to practice &amp;ldquo;Truth, Honesty and Fairness&amp;rdquo;. I also learned meditation so that I can keep myself happy. I am always reminded of Swami&amp;rsquo;s saying - &amp;ldquo;I am always with you, in you, above you and around you&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>One day, Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati had a disagreement. She disappeared and said she would like to see how the world would survive without her.
In the disappearance of Goddess Parvati, the whole world was begging for food. To find a solution, Lord Shiva went to Kashi. There in Kashi, He saw Goddess Parvati in the form of Goddess Annapoorani (an aspect of Devi and is known as the goddess of food and nourishment) distributing food.</description>

      <description>In December 2019, I had an amazing opportunity to visit Prashanti Nilayam, the Abode of Supreme Peace where many of us Sai followers would wish for to see with our very own eyes in this lifetime. I was fortunate that my parents made this trip happen and I eagerly waited for the day to come for many months since they started planning for it.
Our journey started at KLIA where we boarded the flight to Bangalore Airport, India.</description>

      <description>Vijay and Raju were friends. On a holiday they went walking into a forest, enjoying the beauty of nature. Suddenly they saw a bear coming at them. They became frightened.
Raju, who knew all about climbing trees, ran up to a tree and climbed up quickly. He didn’t think of Vijay. Vijay had no idea how to climb a tree. Vijay thought for a second. He has heard before that animals don’t prefer to eat dead bodies, so he fell to the ground and held his breath.</description>
