      <description> This art was inspired by the weekly bhajans in our Sai centre. Small toy human sculptures were portrayed as devotees in a bhajan hall. Some traditional Indian musical instruments were sculptured as well. Small details were added as decorations. Swamiâ€™s portrait was placed in the middle.
