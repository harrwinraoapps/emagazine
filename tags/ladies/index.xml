      <description>The Gita Samarpanam is to be an offering to Bhagawan on Ladies Day for the year 2020.
I grabbed this opportunity to be a part of the sadhana not only as an offering but more importantly to learn to chant the verses. Having tried unsuccessfully and intimidated by the Sanskrit verses, I had given up learning the Bhagavad Gita altogether. Now, with this opportunity, I had it all beautifully planned and laid out smoothly for me, right in the comfort of my home.</description>

      <description>Amidst the widespread of Covid-19 we have all been lifted into another way of living. Our lives have been slowed down by an amazingly small organism with a huge amount of power. In March 2020, when the Movement Control Order was announced, there was sudden fear and panic everywhere.
Each day presented us with a new set of rules and changes that gave us a reason to pause. Schools closing, kids zoning out during endless Zoom classes, holiday plans cancelled.</description>

      <description>When the coronavirus pandemic reached our shores and the Movement Control Order (MCO) was announced, I was paradoxically elated for I chose to look at the positive side. I decided that it was a great opportunity to take a breather from the hectic pace of life that I had become accustomed to. Rather than dwelling on the negativity and worrying unnecessarily over a virus that was restricting our way of life, I decided to make the most of the situation as best I could.</description>
