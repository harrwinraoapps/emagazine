      <description>Let’s get to the point – we all know that spirituality is a practical journey of life towards Him, our Creator. A journey of life is unique to everyone – think about it, is there only ONE way to reach Him?
The whole idea of reaching God involves a myriad of angles – ranging from the complexity of meditation to the simplicity of Bhajans.
The practical teachings of Sai and Hinduism in general allows the participation of every individual from any walks of life, religion, culture, ethnicity, and language.</description>

      <title>Bhajans &amp; Discipline</title>

      <description>Bhajan is not merely an activity done for fun. Yes, it is a lot of fun to sing and be involved in bhajans, but at the same time it is a form of sadhana, a spiritual practice and even a form of Seva as the duty of a bhajan singer is to invoke devotion in oneself and others. Therefore, having said that, this means that discipline forms an integral part of the responsibility of a bhajan singer.</description>

      <description>Sis Jothi Bhai, New Zealand
 True. Only yesterday I was sharing that the &amp;lsquo;intensity of closeness&amp;rsquo; to Swami is felt now more during this Pandemic. More opportunities to go within.
 Sis Veni, Malaysia (Klang)
 Yeah, this pandemic gives us more time to approach Swami and bonding with family, nature and friends.
 Sis Shamani Nadaraja, Malaysia (Klang)
 I have learnt to spend quality time with family doing great things for myself and not forgetting the new friends from the nature.</description>

      <description>Music has always been my passion and the means through which I connect to the Lord. This is a simple offering to render my love to Swami through the first bhajan that He introduced to His devotees.

      <title>My Parthi Experience</title>
      <link>https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/my-parthi-experience/</link>

      <description>My journey with Swami started when I was 7 years old. My neighbour who was also my tuition teacher at that time had introduced Swami to me. At that time, I was too young to realise His guidance and was just fascinated hearing a lot of stories about Puttaparthi.
How it will be?
After over 40 years, finally the day came on 24th Jan 2020, Friday, when I attended my first evening Bhajan in Prasanthi Nilayam, Puttaparthi.</description>

 This photo has many meaningful messages. It gives us an opportunity to ponder on all those moments Swami was there to protect, guard and guide us. I have personally experienced Swami and His love in many ways. It’s so true He is there in all situations. Come let’s share His love with all which will bring us closer to Him.
