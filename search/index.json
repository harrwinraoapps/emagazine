[{"content":" We need to respect nature and living things because the environment is important. I know that hurting the environment in various ways impacts all beings and pollutes the Earth in the long run. Without plants and trees we would not be able to survive. The environment is also good and healthy for us. It helps us to live in the way we please.\nNature is the most important thing in our lives and everyone should know about its importance. Everything we have now, we get it from nature. Everyone is blessed with the true love of good in the form of beautiful nature. Nature gives us relaxation and comfort, it motivates and inspires us.\n Gallery \r\r\n References https://learningin21.edublogs.org/\n ","date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/nature-is-god/img_shriti_surendran_kumar_1_hu504946708734bbb6efe3135750f7217b_5550161_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/nature-is-god/","title":"Nature Is God, God Is Nature"},{"content":" The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.\nIn this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā\u0026rsquo;s newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.\n The Divine Lullaby \r\r Translation Why are you crying? You are pure The name you have acquired is not yours, merely a mind-created fiction applied to you The body is not you, nor are you of it The Lord of the universe doesn't cry either! This sound is an illusion attributed to you The qualities imagined as yours are inherent in all the senses The insignificant elements within the man acquire the condition of growth through the addition of food, water and drink It is not a growth or diminution of You Within the body shell You remain constant Do not become confounded by this body which has been fastened upon you Father, Son, Mother, Wife, Mine, Not Mine Do not assign much significance to what is only an aggregation of elements The deluded man thinks pains alleviate pain The deluded man thinks enjoyment of pleasures gives happiness The intelligent man whose mind is free from confusion knows pleasures and sorrows to be alike The carriage goes upon the earth, the body is seated in the carriage The Self resides within the body The deluded Jiva thinks \"I am this body\" The Self has no attachement to His carriage Foolish is such ignorance! \r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r  ","date":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/the-divine-lullaby/markandeya_hue49d1c80d98445d3abff6193fc86b125_69790_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/the-divine-lullaby/","title":"The Divine Lullaby"},{"content":" In this card I have written a lovely message for Swami and conveyed my birthday wishes to Swami.
