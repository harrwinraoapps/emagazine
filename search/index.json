I was fortunate that my parents made this trip happen and I eagerly waited for the day to come for many months since they started planning for it.\nOur journey started at KLIA where we boarded the flight to Bangalore Airport, India. Puttaparthi is a town in Anantapur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Prashanti Nilayam is the place where Baba resided. When we reached Bangalore, we were greeted by Uncle Kishore who then drove us to Puttarparthi. Uncle Kishore was a humble and kind man. We reached Puttaparthi very late at night so we could not enter the gates of Prashanti Nilayam, therefore we had to put up a night at a hotel nearby. We went to sleep but woke up very early the next morning as I was so excited to see the much talked about place by my Balvikas and parents.\nTime had come, me and my sister got dressed in our white Punjabi suits and the loving Uncle Kishore fetched us from the hotel and drove us again to the Ashram. We reached the accommodation office and met some our friends Uncle Vimal and Aunty Ballet from Singapore who were eagerly waiting for us who greeted us with so much of love. We got our rooms and the experience from here was out of this world. We spent a lot of time in family satsangh and togetherness with our extended family from Singapore, Melbourne and Johor.\nWe got our map of the Ashram and started planning all that were going to do and places to visit and most importantly I wanted to have Western food! The things I enjoyed the most in Parthi was the food and bhajans. I had yummy ice cream, hot chocolate, toast and much more at the western canteen I frequented almost every day. Me and my sister spent most of our time at Bhajans, Vedic chanting, meals, visits to the mall and others with my mother, Aunty Ballet, Vidya and Vina Akka since they had strict rules of men and women being separated.\nThe bhajans were divine and I never missed a single bhajan. The atmosphere and surrounding was just so pleasant, calm and peaceful. Swami’s samadhi was divine and beautiful. We got to get his blessings everyday after bhajans.\nMy father made plans for us to visit Swami’s birth place, the Chitravathi river, Super speciality hospital, Kalpavriksha tree and few others. On the last day we visited the Chaitanya Jyothi Museum which was built 20 years ago to mark the 75th birthday of Baba. The museum spectacular and we also met Aunty Jaya who comes to Prashanti every year to serve at the Chaitanya Jyothi museum. It was nice to see her.\nMy experience in this whole adventure was wonderful and blissful. I would love to visit Prashanti again when the pandemic comes to an end.\n Gallery \r\r\n ","date":"2020-10-23T00:00:00Z","image":"http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/abode-of-peace/img_shreya_eshani_1_hu96b410fa6ec7ac6a13d9944b30375074_153168_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/abode-of-peace/","title":"My Visit to the Abode of Supreme Peace"},{"content":" The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.\nIn this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā\u0026rsquo;s newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.\n The Divine Lullaby \r\r Translation Why are you crying? You are pure The name you have acquired is not yours, merely a mind-created fiction applied to you The body is not you, nor are you of it The Lord of the universe doesn't cry either! This sound is an illusion attributed to you The qualities imagined as yours are inherent in all the senses The insignificant elements within the man acquire the condition of growth through the addition of food, water and drink It is not a growth or diminution of You Within the body shell You remain constant Do not become confounded by this body which has been fastened upon you Father, Son, Mother, Wife, Mine, Not Mine Do not assign much significance to what is only an aggregation of elements The deluded man thinks pains alleviate pain The deluded man thinks enjoyment of pleasures gives happiness The intelligent man whose mind is free from confusion knows pleasures and sorrows to be alike The carriage goes upon the earth, the body is seated in the carriage The Self resides within the body The deluded Jiva thinks \"I am this body\" The Self has no attachement to His carriage Foolish is such ignorance! \r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r  ","date":"2020-10-19T00:00:00Z","image":"http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/the-divine-lullaby/markandeya_hue49d1c80d98445d3abff6193fc86b125_69790_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/the-divine-lullaby/","title":"The Divine Lullaby"},{"content":" Shveta\u0026rsquo;s Trifle Pudding \r\r\r.pdfv {\rmargin: 10px auto 20px;\rdisplay: block;\r}\r  ","date":"2020-10-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"http://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/trifle-pudding/","title":"Shveta's Trifle Pudding"}]
