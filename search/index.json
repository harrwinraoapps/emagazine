[{"content":" The story of Queen Madālasā is in Chapters 25-30 of the Mārkaṇḍeya Purāṇa. The Mārkaṇḍeya is one of the eighteen ‘great Purāṇas’ (Mahāpurāṇas) relating to Brahmā, said to have been narrated by the Riṛṣi Mārkaṇḍeya.\nIn this mythological tale, Queen Madālasā\u0026rsquo;s newborn child was named by the King. Upon hearing the name given by the King, the baby started to cry out loud. Madālasā sings this beautiful lullaby to pacify the child.\n The Divine Lullaby \r\r Translation    Meaning     Why are you crying?   You are pure   The name you have acquired is not yours, merely a mind-created fiction applied to you   The body is not you, nor are you of it   The Lord of the universe doesn\u0026rsquo;t cry either!   This sound is an illusion attributed to you   The qualities imagined as yours are inherent in all the senses   The insignificant elements within the man acquire the condition of growth through the addition of food, water and drink   It is not a growth or diminution of You   Within the body shell   You remain constant   Do not become confounded by this body which has been fastened upon you   Father, Son, Mother, Wife, Mine, Not Mine   Do not assign much significance to what is only an aggregation of elements   The deluded man thinks pains alleviate pain   The deluded man thinks enjoyment of pleasures gives happiness   The intelligent man whose mind is free from confusion knows pleasures and sorrows to be alike   The carriage goes upon the earth, the body is seated in the carriage   The Self resides within the body   The deluded Jiva thinks \u0026ldquo;I am this body\u0026rdquo;   The Self has no attachement to His carriage   Foolish is such ignorance!
