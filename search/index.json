[{"content":" Let’s get to the point – we all know that spirituality is a practical journey of life towards Him, our Creator. A journey of life is unique to everyone – think about it, is there only ONE way to reach Him?\nThe whole idea of reaching God involves a myriad of angles – ranging from the complexity of meditation to the simplicity of Bhajans.\nThe practical teachings of Sai and Hinduism in general allows the participation of every individual from any walks of life, religion, culture, ethnicity, and language. It is the way of life. We are given a choice of various sadhanas to partake in, as long as it abides by the five Human Values we’ve all come to experience by just being His devotee – Sathya, Dharma, Shanthi, Prema, Ahimsa.\nBeing born into a Sai family, I consider myself privileged to have experienced the power of Bhajans from the premature moments of my life in my mother’s womb.\nBHAJANS – the beautiful convergence of Bhava (feel), Raaga (melody), and Taala (rhythm) in its simplest form is a nursery rhyme.\nNursery rhyme? Isn’t that something we learn when we attend kindergarten? – But if we could just think about it – Bhajans is actually a story of good over evil that is sung in a poetic and rhythmic manner.\nRight, enough with the theories. Let’s get to the point. I believe Bhajans is the easiest way to seek and reach Him. Let me give you seven reasons why.\nBLISSFUL\nBliss – the purest form of happiness, love, and peace is easily attainable through the singing of God’s name. According to Swami himself:\n\"Devotional singing induces in you a desire for experiencing the truth, to glimpse the beauty that is God, to taste the bliss that is the Self. It encourages man to dive into himself and be genuinely his real Self.\"\rSathyam Shivam Sundaram VII, 497-498\r\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r Give it a try – choose your favourite Bhajan, understand the story behind the song, close your eyes, and sing your hearts out!\nHONEST\nApart from being a devotional song, Bhajans, if seen from a personalised perspective, are an honest plea to God. You do not sing for the admiration of others, nor do you play the Tabla to show your capabilities. It is a personal sadhana of every individual involved. Swami beautifully phrases it like this:\n\"Devotional singing (bhajans) is the process of singing that originates in the heart, not from the lips or the tongue. It is the expression of the joyous thrill that wells up from the heart when the Glory of God is remembered. It is the spontaneous manifestation of inner ecstasy. No attention is paid to the blame or praise that others may give. It does not seek the admiration or the appreciation of the listeners.\"\rSathyam Shivam Sundaram X, 84\r\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r ATMOSPHERIC\nHere’s a fun fact – music is produced through vibrations and the sense of spiritualism is also felt through vibrations – which is why we call it \u0026ldquo;good vibes\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;bad vibes\u0026rdquo; right?\nThe exact same concept applies to Bhajan singing – a multitude of divine vibrations radiating around us, energising all those within the vicinity and beyond. Swami says:\n\"The vibrations emanating from them make the heart vibrant. If you sing alone in your shrine, the vibrations return to you as a reaction. But in community singing, what you have is not a reaction but a wave of vibrations. They enter into the atmosphere and purify the polluted air. The atmosphere today is polluted by bad thoughts and feelings. When you sing the glory of God, the bad germs in the air are destroyed and the air gets purified by a treatment of anti-biotics, as it were.\"\rSanathana Sarathi, January 1995, 26\r\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r JOYFUL\nEver since I was a kid, one activity that excites me the most is Bhajans! It puts me in a mood to be happy and energised, filling me up with joyful thoughts prior, during, and post-Bhajans. Yes, there are songs with melancholic moods, but have you ever realised, in the end – we feel content, happy, and joyful. Some Bhajans make us cry but it is the tear of joy. No bhajans in the world make us tear out of anger and depression.\n\"Those who sing bhajans get what can be called a 'double promotion', for they derive joy and distribute joy.\"\rSathyam Shivam Sundaram X, 101\r\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r Conclusively, isn\u0026rsquo;t that what we all desire? To be joyful?\nACHIEVABLE\nThe skill of delivering a Bhajan relies on the three essence which makes up Bhajan – Bhava, Raaga, and Taala. With constant practice, the art of feeling a Bhajan instead of performing, is easily achievable.\nChoose a song, start simple, understand the meaning, and let the visuals project in your head – you’ll get Bhava in the form of a story. Raaga and Taala will soon be of second nature to you through continuous practice.\nRemember, the foundation to delivering a good Bhajan is practice. This does not matter whether you’re singing in the centre or in the comfort of your own home – the goal is always, to please Him no matter the circumstances. If it’s for Him, it’s always a must to deliver the best, right?\n\"Devotional singing (bhajan) is one of the processes by which you can train the mind to expand into eternal values. Teach the mind to revel in the glory and majesty of God; wean it away from petty horizons of pleasure. Devotional singing induces in you a desire for experiencing the truth, to glimpse the beauty that is God, to taste the bliss that is the Self. It encourages man to dive into himself and be genuinely his real Self.\"\rSathyam Shivam Sundaram VII, 497-498\r\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r NUTRITIOUS\nBhajans feed the body, mind, and soul with positive energy – the only nutrient needed in the path to attain Moksha. When we participate in Bhajans, we train the mind to constantly chant the name of various deities in various languages and tunes, empowering ourselves with the energy and motion to lead us back to THE source.\n\"Some people... question the propriety of calling God by means of... a multiplicity of names. But each name is indicative of only one aspect of Divinity. It denotes a single part of the Supreme Personality... Every name is but a facet, a part, a ray of the Supreme. The spiritual discipline consists in recognising and becoming aware of the One that supports and sustains the many. That is the precious gem of wisdom that one must secure and treasure.\"\rSathyam Shivam Sundaram X, 87\r\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r This is, in a nutshell – the essence of spirituality. The various forms we favour are just mere avenues to channel our energy towards the right direction, but we all know there is only one God, and He is omnipresent. Bhajans, help us realise that.\nSPIRITUAL\nFrom what has been derived so far, I personally feel Bhajans encompasses what we call spirituality. It embodies the SAI in us, guides us towards the right path, with various accessible avenues to enable everyone to participate in.\nLet us not forget, participating in Bhajans does not only happen in the centre by being part of the Bhajan Team. In fact, the Bhajan Team just acts as a guide to standardise and ensure high-quality Bhajans are delivered.\nBut in the end, what makes Bhajans the simplest form of spiritual sadhana is the way it is designed – it can be conducted anywhere, whether in a group or individually as long as there is a firm conviction to reach Swami. It amazes me how personal yet collective Bhajans are.\nIf you have not realised yet, my seven points actually lie within the word \u0026ldquo;Bhajans\u0026rdquo; – \u0026ldquo;Blissful, Honest, Atmospheric, Joyful, Achievable, Nutritious, Spiritual\u0026rdquo;. Never forget that answers are always in the questions we ask – it is never that far. It just requires effort and dedication with a pure heart.\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/way-to-god/","title":"7 Reasons Why Bhajans Are The Simplest Way To God"},{"content":" In this card, I have written a lovely message which was given by our beloved Swami, Birthday wishes, Swami’s picture and were added decorations like flowers.\n Birthday Card \r\r Gallery \r\r \r\r\n References  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nq9pbsVecFs   ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/birthday-card/img_tivyssha_sai_1_huf0af57b9f734ba74c3635e5a35236ab7_44808_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/birthday-card/","title":"A Birthday Card For Swami"},{"content":" In this card I have written a lovely message for Swami and conveyed my birthday wishes to Swami.

Salutations to Bhagawan Sri Sathya Sai Baba, and thank you Swami for all the blessings.\nDedication: I thank my beloved wife for her courage and composure and her unflagging love and support for the duration of my recent hospitalisation.\nIt started with an unusual busy travel week, the 18th to 23rd February 2018. I drove a honeymoon couple on a tour, covering Malacca, Kuala Lumpur and Genting Highlands. But on the 21st February itself, I was already feeling a little unwell. On that day, I came back home early, by 5 pm, and rested. But by Friday, the 23rd February, I was getting weaker, and on that day, I asked my wife Santhi to drive, while I accompanied her. We dropped the guests at the airport and returned home. Santhi insisted on taking me to our family doctor\u0026rsquo;s clinic. The doctor thought it was just a normal cough, and prescribed antibiotics.\nBy Tuesday the 27th, the situation was worsening, and I went to the clinic again. This time, the doctor put me on drips, and treated me to two rounds of nebulizer. While the doctor wanted to admit me, I did not want to be admitted. I had a problem in my workplace because a driver had put in a sudden resignation.\nI was driving the van, all the while coughing badly. Santhi stayed with me all the time. As my condition got worse, she courageously took on the driver role. I continued the acute coughing, and soon the vomiting started.\nWe dropped off all the students we were ferrying, and she drove me to the Klang General Hospital Emergency Department. I was put in a wheelchair and rushed to the Red Zone. I was panting quite badly by then, out of breath.\nI was immediately put on drips, and the doctors started examining me. As I waited for admission, I told Santhi to go back and rest. By 4 am, I was brought to ward 8B, and closely monitored by doctors. Blood samples were taken for various tests.\nMy wife came in early the next morning, and the doctor explained my condition. She left around noon to drive the van to pick up the school students. But as she was on her way, the hospital called her. My condition had deteriorated quickly.\nShe quickly managed to get someone to help to drive the van and rushed to the hospital. The doctors told her that my condition was critical, and I had to be moved to the ICU.\nAll I remember is being wheeled to the ICU, and the security guard stopping my wife following me inside. I was in tears. Everything happened so quickly. I was transferred to the bed, my clothes changed and the tubes and gadgets attached. I was always aware of all the happenings but felt weak and in a daze.\nMoments of bliss\nFrom this moment I lost track of time. My only thought was, \u0026ldquo;Baba, I am surrendering to you\u0026rdquo;. No other thoughts there onwards.\nI felt a strange sense of relaxation and thoughtlessness and began enjoying the moments of peace and bliss.\nEvery day, during the visiting hours, Santhi would rush to me and assure me that I was alright - \u0026ldquo;Babe, you are doing good\u0026rdquo;. She would keep applying Vibhuti on my chest and on my forehead. The smell of Vibhutii was everywhere throughout.\nMy posture on the bed was relaxed and so comfortable that I felt no pain at all. I was constantly in the same cool, happy mode! No worries at all. I just knew that during every visiting hour, many would come. They would touch me and comfort me.\nI was not wearing my spectacles, but recognized almost everyone who came. The touch and prayer and comforting words made me constantly in a positive mood.\nDoctors attended to me day and night – I could hear them as they spoke. And whenever I opened my eyes, they would ask how I was doing and how I felt. I would always respond that I was fine, and give a thumbs up. I was honestly feeling well.\nDivine moments\nOften I would suddenly hear chanting (with energy like the early morning Omkar at Prashanti). I would open my eyes, and see no one at my side. I would close my eyes again, and just enjoy the moments of bliss.\nThen one day, a doctor told me that I was tired, and that he was going to put me on a relaxation medication. The next thing I knew\u0026hellip; I felt myself hanging… my mind was calling \u0026ldquo;Mohana\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip; but the body was just hanging. As I enjoyed these moments of calm and peace, suddenly I saw a few tall angel-like figure\u0026hellip; dressed in white\u0026hellip; I watched them\u0026hellip; until they disappeared.\nAs the days went by, many strange incidents happened. One day I had a dream\u0026hellip; my late mom appeared before me. She said, \u0026ldquo;There is nothing to worry\u0026hellip; everything will be alright.\u0026rdquo; Another day, my late brother and I were in a dream, sitting near my office, outside the building facing the car park. We were sitting and talking casually. In front of us, my dark blue Volkswagen van was parked. Suddenly my brother asked me to take a look at the Audi 2 seater left hand drive car, hidden, beside the Volkswagen. And suddenly, the scene disappeared.\nWhenever I woke up after these dreams, I felt reassured that I was alright, and will be out of hospital soon.\nOnce my wife came, looking very tired. She told me, \u0026ldquo;Babe, I just meditated and sent the light energy to you. You take care. I will come and see you tomorrow.\u0026rdquo; I just nodded. That same night, I saw a triple bulb laser pointer-like light, blinking a pinkish light, with seven shades of colours, very short and swift bursts of light.\nDream or hallucination?\nBro Harwinrao used to always visit me, and one day he told me, \u0026ldquo;Uncle we checked, all are ok except a few are having negative energy.\u0026rdquo; What he was referring to were bundles of humans hanging in the curtain railing in a dark blue cloth! Was this a dream? Or hallucination? When I opened my eyes, I did not see anyone - I had a similar experience when I was in the ward upon being moved out of the ICU.\nI was always coated with Vibuthi – I was assured that Swami is always there.\nAs soon I was admitted in the ICU, I saw two lines - one upper line and a lower line (l considered this the consciousness line). Each time I reached the top line I would feel enjoyment and calm. At times I started to be at the lower line – and I would feel the attachment, and then would come the cough, with my nose sensitive to odour, heat / warmth of people coming close to me. If anyone came with perfume, I got a suffocating feeling. Feeling the discomfort, I would close my eyes and stay calm to move to the upper line.\nDaily the nurses will bathe me – it was always at 11pm, and that was the only time I was aware of. They would wash me with hot/ warm water, using shower cream. I would feel very clean - no body odour whatsoever while in ICU. In short it was a very blissful life!\nThe doctors and nurses would explain clearly everything that they intended to do, so I would be fully aware of the process. For example I need to swallow when the milk is fed every 3 hourly. The oxygen mask also had to be frequently changed, depending on the reading on the gadgets.\nSome of the above could be hallucinations, dreams or visions influenced from my past learning experiences or memory recollections. Some of the moments are difficult to explain. But for more than 90% of the time, I was awake and aware, certainly not asleep.\nIn spite of the seriousness of the ailment, the overall experience was not unpleasant, and credit goes to Swami, to my dear wife, and to all those loving souls who prayed intensely.\nWhat I did not know\nWhile I was having this experience, others heard that my condition was deteriorating – the doctor gave a mere 20% chance of survival !\nOn 2nd March, as I was in the ward using Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP), before the Oxygen level saturated below 90. Then I was moved to the High Dependency unit. An urgent SOS – a call for intensified prayers went out. Messages on whatsapp would urge, \u0026ldquo;Let us do a group Gayatri Chanting, 9 times at 9pm tonight, for our dear lovely Bro Mohana who is admitted in GH Klang for pneumonia. Our group prayers will help him recover and be back to normalcy speedily\u0026hellip; set a reminder on your phone.\u0026rdquo;\nA second SOS, on March 3rd urged, \u0026ldquo;Sairam dear All. Please continue your prayers. Bro Mohana is in Klang GH ICU Ward under assisted ventilation and antibiotics. We need to pray specifically for Swami to give him the strength to recover.\u0026rdquo;\nAfter this - on Sunday, my wife and Sis Anjulah asked me whether I would like to have any gadget like an iPod or iPhone to listen to Bhajans, but I declined. I explained the two lines I continued to see as consciousness, and I was enjoying the blissful experience all the time.\nWhenever my wife or anyone put their hands on my chest, I could feel the stress they were going through. I even reassured my wife, \u0026ldquo;Sayang, I am fine and you just need to relax - I can feel your tension in the form of weight in your arm.\u0026rdquo; Sometimes I could even smell the toxin in Santhi\u0026rsquo;s breath, and told her to go and see a doctor.\nShe would tell me everyone is praying for me, she was always very courageous – she made me move on the single line upward and maintain my composure and inner peace.\nI must express my heartfelt gratitude to each and every staff member of HTAR, Klang. They are angels, born to serve, and they do this passionately and dedicatedly, attending to every request from urinal pan to bed pan. They took care of me, leaving no room for any complaint.\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/divine-will/","title":"Abundance is Divine Will"},{"content":" Bhajan - Anand Se Bolo Jai Baba Jai \r\r ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/bhajan-for-swami/","title":"Anand Se Bolo Jai Baba Jai"},{"content":" Gallery \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-baby/img_khayern_murali_2_huf1a61eb96e8dd7cc8f795cccc1ed7a19_49139_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-baby/","title":"Baba and Baby"},{"content":" This card is my dedication to Swami on His 95th Birthday.\nBirthday Card Dedication \r\r ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-birthday/","title":"Baba's Birthday"},{"content":" Happy birthday to my dearest Baba, the ultimate Love of my Life.\nHere is a simple gift box made especially for YOU.\nMy wish on Your birthday is for everyone in this world to have sparkling and glittering hearts filled with Love, helping and uplifting one another.

Yes, it is a lot of fun to sing and be involved in bhajans, but at the same time it is a form of sadhana, a spiritual practice and even a form of Seva as the duty of a bhajan singer is to invoke devotion in oneself and others. Therefore, having said that, this means that discipline forms an integral part of the responsibility of a bhajan singer. Furthermore, Swami Himself has emphasised on the importance of discipline in every walk of life be it education, spirituality or service.\nSai bhajans is a group sadhana as it is not only the lead singer who is involved in the sadhana but everyone singing chorus, the instrumentalist and even the technical (audio/video) sevadals.\nSwami has a beautiful way of playing with words. Once during a Trayee session with the students, Swami said:\n\"If you want to be called a boy; you should have behaviour; If you want to be called a man; you should have manners; And if you want to be called a devotee; you should have DISCIPLINE.\"\n\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r Interestingly, Swami does not say to be a devotee we need devotion. He said discipline defines a Sai devotee. Swami has said that devotion is like a river. So long it flows between 2 banks referred to as Duty and Devotion, it will reach the ocean. However, the moment this river of devotion breaches these 2 banks, the same river becomes Destruction. The following are some of the points that come to my mind based on the various talks and sharing sessions from Swami’s students who are Prasanthi Mandir Bhajan singers on the aspects of discipline that are important for a Sai Bhajan singer.\n  Sing and participate during every bhajan in a bhajan session.\n A lead singer and every chorus singer should participate (sing and clap) fully in every bhajan during a bhajan session. The lead singer should not only sing their bhajan and then not sing during the other bhajans sung in the session.    Punctuality is a key requirement for bhajan singers.\n All bhajans singers, instrumentalist and technical sevadals should be ready in advance for bhajans. There should be 10-15 minutes of silence and absolute peace before the bhajan starts to help us prepare our minds and hearts to imbibe the divine energy.    Restriction of movement during bhajans.\n All bhajan singers and instrumentalists should minimize movements during bhajans. There should be no unnecessary movements during bhajans. This is to avoid any sort of distraction to others in the session. Swami wants us to still our mind and body during bhajans. Only when we can still our body, can we expect our mind to be still. In fact, this also applied to all chorus singers and all members that are part of a bhajan session. Everyone should be part of the bhajan session and be still in mind and body, they should not be engaged in other activities during the bhajan session.    No talking during bhajans.\n Unless there is a real need to discuss an urgent matter regarding the bhajan session (such as shruthi, mic issues, etc) there should be no talking or chatting during bhajan sessions. This again applies predominantly for the lead bhajan singers and instrumentalists, but it is also applicable to all chorus singers and members of the bhajan session.    Involvement in the organisation.\n Every bhajan singer should also take on the duty and responsibility to be involved in various other aspects of service and spiritual practice in the organisation/Sai centre. A bhajan singer should make an effort to engage in other activities such as service, education, ladies and youth activities to set a good example of practicing Swami’s values and principles.    Self- study and self-audit about bhajan singing.\n All bhajan singers should spend time and take the effort to read and listen to various materials regarding bhajans. We should listen to discourses from Swami regarding bhajans, listen to talks and satsanghs by the members of the Prasanthi Bhajan Group. This will help in improving the technical and devotional aspect of singing bhajans. Lastly, self-audit is also an extremely important aspect for bhajan singers. All bhajan singers, especially lead bhajan singers should have the humility to reflect on areas of improvement and work on bettering ourselves to ensure we are able to offer our best to Swami through bhajans.    \"Devotional singing (bhajan) must become an unbroken stream of bliss on your tongues and in your hearts; It must confer on you the uninterrupted awareness of soham, of the unity of I and He.

The first song is known as \u0026ldquo;Ragupathi Ragava Raja Ram\u0026rdquo; which talks about Lord Rama and His selfless love to people around him. I have dedicated this song to Swamiji as I personally feel both of them have the same characteristics. I have read many stories about Swamiji and realized His selfless love towards His devotee around Him. He takes many different forms to help those who have surrendered to him.\nWhereas, the second song is known as “Ra Ra Venugopala”. This song is to invite Swamiji into my life to guide me on following the righteous path to succeed in my life. Besides, I do take this opportunity to express my gratitude towards Swamiji who created this opportunity for me to participate in His 95th birthday event and demonstrate my musical talent. Thank you so much Swamiji.\nI’ve been learning veenai since 2014.

My mom knows how to play veenai too and she has taught me some devotional songs since I was 10 years old.\nDuring rehearsals and recording sessions I have been facing many troubles and obstacles.

Having tried unsuccessfully and intimidated by the Sanskrit verses, I had given up learning the Bhagavad Gita altogether. Now, with this opportunity, I had it all beautifully planned and laid out smoothly for me, right in the comfort of my home. Classes were to be conducted through Zoom conferencing, in light of the coronavirus pandemic. What a blessing!!! Classes commenced on the 22nd of June 2020 and it was conducted by Sister Girija, who was well versed in the subject as she was exposed to spirituality at a tender age. She had grown up on the lap of her uncle, the spiritual leader, Swami Chinmayananda. We were blessed to have her teaching us. Sister Girija began her sadhana with an introduction into the scene of the Kurukshetra war and a glimpse into Chapter 12. I was completely blown away and thought to myself “what had I missed all my life”. It has taken me six decades to get a peek into this treasure trove of wisdom. “Well, better late than never”, I consoled myself. By the end of the first class I was in bliss and I was beaming with happiness. From then on, I began to yearn to know more and experienced an indescribable feeling of pure joy after each session.\nSister Girija began to unravel the meaning of each verse on Arjuna’s enquiry to Lord Krishna. Her explanations were soul stirring and she narrated stories and shared life experiences of great saints thereby demonstrating her vast knowledge on the Bhagavad Gita. It was a real treat to all who were blessed to attend and gain her insights. Her constant encouragement to keep our enthusiasm and earnest longing to learn gave us the inspiration to do our best in the chanting of the verses. A mammoth task lay in front of me that needed a lot of effort. I realised that in order to transform this knowledge into bhakti, I would need to integrate it with my life or “it will be a useless tinsel”, as said by Adi Shankara. Practice, practice and practice is now my constant reminder. Doable by making small steps echoes my inner voice. It took Sister Girija 10 days to complete the 20 verses and then she taught us the Bhagavad Gita Dhyanam or Meditation on the Gita.\nThese verses are sung before the recitation or as an invocation to the Gita. All the verses learnt have such a profound meaning in my life now.\nAll of a sudden, the Covid-19 cases began to rise again and we faced another movement control order. The pandemic now challenged us to complete our offering together in conjunction with Ladies Day 2020. All of us (SSBC Bandar Klang was represented by Sis Jenobai, Sis Nirmala, Sis Sudha and myself with Sis Nageswary from Sri Muda Centre joining us) held on strongly to shraddha or faith in the Lord with no doubt. We were then advised that each centre would need to record their recital (we were given 4 verses to recite) and these recordings would then be compiled to be presented to our Bhagavan on the 19th of November. With divine grace, we gathered in Sister Nirmala’s house on the 18th of October for the video recording. With the kind effort of Bro Naveen, Sis Chandini, Bro Lekshman and all the sisters, we completed our task.\nCurrently, we are continuing our revision on all the 20 verses from Chapter 12 and will humbly present it to our Swami with all our love and gratitude on the 19th of November 2020.\nI am ever so grateful to Aunty Jegadeva and Sis Girija for making it possible to be a part of this sadhana. Most of all, my humble salutations to Bhagavan for without His Divine Grace, this would never have been possible as “Not a Blade of Grass Moves Without His Will”.\n Mookam Karoti Vachalam\nPangum Lankayathe Girim\nYath Krupa Thamaham Vandhe\nParamananda Madhavam\n\nI remember with Devotion the Divine Grace of Krishna Who can make the Dumb speak with eloquence and the Lame cross high Mountains.

One day as Diya was playing, she thought to herself \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t I have a tea party with Swami? Swami will be delighted.\u0026rdquo;\nAs she went on preparing for the tea party, she was in a hurry to make it the perfect party. However, her house was in a mess and she was upset.\nAt that moment, her friend Arjun was cycling past her house. Diya called out to Arjun and asked him if he could help her clean the house. Arjun agreed and started to help Diya.\nAs time flew, the place was cleaned up and the tea party was ready. The tea had been made by her mother along with freshly baked cookies from the oven and Diya had changed into a beautiful pink dress. Diya thanked Arjun and told him that she was now waiting for Swami.\nHearing this, Arjun said, \u0026ldquo;Dear Diya, I am already here, don\u0026rsquo;t you realize who I am?\u0026rdquo;. At this point, Diya saw a lovely image of her beloved Swami on the face of Arjun and was amazed with the image she saw. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t realised that Arjun was all along, her beloved Swami. \u0026ldquo;Oh Swami! I didn\u0026rsquo;t realise it was YOU! Swami replied, \u0026ldquo;Diya, I\u0026rsquo;m always in you, with you and around you, no matter what. Come let\u0026rsquo;s have our tea now\u0026rdquo;, said Swami and Diya smiled, so pleased.\nAs she was having her tea, she heard a loud bell go off \u0026ldquo;Ringggggg\u0026hellip;..\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Diya, Diya wake up. It\u0026rsquo;s time for school\u0026rdquo;. It was the sound of her mother waking her up. Diya woke up as the morning sun shone on her face along with its lovely breeze, as her mother drew the curtains open.\nAt this point, Diya realised that her tea party with Swami was all but a dream. Remembering her dream, she broke into a beautiful smile, as she heard Swami’s words once again in her ears:\n \u0026ldquo;Diya I\u0026rsquo;m always in you, with you and around you, no matter what.\u0026rdquo;\n  ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/diyas-love/","title":"Diya's Love for Swami"},{"content":" \r\r ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-birthday-drawing/","title":"Drawing"},{"content":" Swami always reminds us that we have the solution to all problems, provided we follow good moral facts and guidance.

Our lives have been slowed down by an amazingly small organism with a huge amount of power. In March 2020, when the Movement Control Order was announced, there was sudden fear and panic everywhere.\nEach day presented us with a new set of rules and changes that gave us a reason to pause. Schools closing, kids zoning out during endless Zoom classes, holiday plans cancelled. There was so much uncertainty and a feeling of being out of control. My world somewhat came to a pause. I had so many questions on my mind, how do I put this together? I need to continue working, my kids needed to keep the momentum going with lessons, my staff needed direction, I wouldn’t be seeing my mother whom I met every day and many more. It was a choice we needed to make on being careful and social distancing to keep the young ones and elderly safe even though we stayed so close to each other. Of course, there was my husband holding the fort together, and I too felt that we must deal with this together as we had little lives dependent on us.\nIt is then I sat and calmed myself and told myself - you’ve got this! Instead of asking, “When will this all end?” I asked, “How can I grow from this?” Swami once said,\n \u0026ldquo;Why get agitated? Let Me take care of all your business. I shall be the one who will think about them. I am waiting for nothing else than your surrender to Me, and then you do not have to worry anymore about anything. Say farewell to all fears and discouragement.\u0026rdquo;\n I began positive self-talk. It’s amazing how positive self-talk influences your subconscious mind and reveals thoughts, beliefs and ideas. As I began doing this daily, I had a sense of calmness and peace. My husband too was of great support to my emotional well-being and kept reassuring me that even this shall pass. I was able to think more clearly, my mind was just on prayer! That is the one thing that was within my control that I could do. I set aside all the unanswered questions and began putting things in action. My girls and I would recite the Gayathri Mantra 108 times every morning, afternoon and evening. Followed by collated prayers with members of the Organisation. The daily prayers then led to self-reflection and gratitude.\nI realised even during the hardest of times there was still so much that I could authentically be grateful for. I woke up and thanked GOD for the air and light. For the ability to see and smell. For this very gift of life and giving me the chance to begin each day. And even if it was for just a few moments a day, I felt so grateful for the tiniest details I noticed around me; for shelter, sunrise, food and the greatest of all was having my family safe and sound.\nWe started to plan our meals together as a family. I always loved cooking and baking and this was the best time to experiment more, yet being moderate. My girls were taught to prepare very simple meals, we baked together, we sat down and did activities together, we played board games, we designed clothes for their collection of Barbie dolls, we painted together, there were endless movie nights and gardening on top of my daily routine of Working from Home. As days went by, I began to feel more at peace, more joy and surely a deeper sense of gratitude. I looked around me and realised I had my girls and husband, right here beside me. Something I have been longing for for a long time. There were moments in my life as a working mother when I would have the working-mom-guilt. I felt time running so fast to achieve my career aspirations, while my kids were growing up so quickly. But in a blink of an eye even this changed. That’s when I recalled Swami saying\n \u0026ldquo;Love My Uncertainty\u0026rdquo;\n I don’t know how or when the pandemic will end, but I know that the miracle of life is now. I thank Swami for this beautiful gift of life and for my loving family. To me, family is not just an important thing but it is EVERYTHING.\n Gallery \r\r \r\r \r\r \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/family-is-everything/img2_hubb687ee8103ed61f37631c899396afa6_51317_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/family-is-everything/","title":"Family is EVERYTHING"},{"content":" Finger Family Song \r\r ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/song-finger-family/","title":"Finger Family Song"},{"content":" Gayatri has 3 important aspects: Gayatri, Savitri and Saraswathi. What are these three? What do they signify?\nThe 1st Gayatri – Gaya means limbs of the body, the senses of the body. Gayatri means that which will take care of the effective functioning and well being of the body and senses. Gayatri means that the well-being of the body will be taken care of. Health is guaranteed. It is very important to have a sound mind in a sound body. It begins with the body. Any pursuit of learning in life begins with the body. This body is made of five elements. Swami speaks of this body as materialisation. Materialisation is in one sense composed of five elements.\nThe 2nd aspect – Savitri stands for life principle. It is not good enough to have only a good body. The body works only because of the life principle. Life is a gift of God. With money we can buy medicine, the aspect that is Savitri. Gayatri is the body – materialisation. Savitri is life – Swami calls it vibration, meaning the body has limbs but there should be vibration to make it work or move.\nThe 3rd aspect is Saraswathi – is the faculty of speech of words. It is emphasised that everything that is spoken should be the truth. This truth is not ordinary or scientific truth. It is unchangeable, eternal and permanent, it is beyond time and space. Such a kind of truth is verbally spoken and is called the aspect of Saraswathi. Saraswathi is the source. The truth is the source. The unknowable (beyond the limits of human experience or understanding), the unchangeable, the permanent, the eternal truth. This is called radiation according to Swami. So, radiation is the source. It is a thermal power station. It is the one out of which everything originates. So the central source of activity is the eternal truth. Saraswathi – radiation. This radiation at the operational level is the vibration – Savitri. This vibration which enters into our body makes our senses and limbs operate. So radiation leads to vibration and this vibration will make the body function effectively.\nThe body – materialisation – Gayatri (Bhur)\nThe life – vibration – Savitri (Bhuvah)\nThe truth – radiation – Saraswathi (Suwaha)\n Gallery \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/gayatri_mantra/img_ambekadevi_rajathurai_1_hu6e8bd413496e0fb645c39472a2d4ede6_322474_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.JPG","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/gayatri_mantra/","title":"Gayatri Mantra"},{"content":" Gallery \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/greeting-card/img_sashviikaa_suresh_1_hu43ee3220ab8ce4cbb3379f8015a1bf87_75709_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/greeting-card/","title":"Greeting Card"},{"content":" \r\r Gallery \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/birthday-drawings-for-baba/img_dhiveesh_hued8669d667412377733a261e389c8fff_64516_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/birthday-drawings-for-baba/","title":"Happy Birthday Baba"},{"content":" Gallery \r\r \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/birthday-card-for-baba-1/img_pramesh_2_hue74e64f25563e888a606284235283a7b_33521_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/birthday-card-for-baba-1/","title":"Happy Birthday Baba"},{"content":" Gallery \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/happy-birthday-baba/img_aadheera_1_hu38249ce2d4433cbb67d3cbdc01f3882b_56465_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/happy-birthday-baba/","title":"Happy Birthday Baba"},{"content":" \r\r ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/a-song-called-sai-ram/","title":"Happy Birthday Baba"},{"content":" \r\r Gallery \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/happy-birthday-sai-baba/img_yatish_shanmugam_hu06ef67a18825f70cf858471f9166c80d_38381_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/happy-birthday-sai-baba/","title":"Happy Birthday Sai Baba"},{"content":" Gallery \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/drawing-for-swami-1/img_keishav_shanmugam_1_hu38c95b7dc1ab487dad55c548c3dd88f1_48458_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/drawing-for-swami-1/","title":"Happy Birthday Swami"},{"content":" This story tells that two friends were walking through a desert.

Love is the basis of human life.\nIf we see the world with love, it would be filled with positivity. When we live our lives with love, our lives get purified. We start seeing the good in everyone and put the negativity behind us. This is something that is very important especially in this generation. Love is pure and unconditional when it comes purely from the heart.\n“God is love; live in love”. God, who is the embodiment of love, can only be experienced through love. Love directed towards God is pure, unconditional and selfless. Devotion signifies love. Love for the divine is the only true form of love. Swami is truly the incarnation of love. When one is filled with love, the other four human values - truth, non-violence, peace and right conduct, would also be attained.\nOne should be prepared to sacrifice for a loved one. That is true love. Only when we “live in love”, can we fully understand the true nature of love. Saying the words, “ I love you” is very common but whether we say it from the bottom of our hearts is what matters.\nSwami has taught us to spread love to everyone, every living being. When we spread love, we also receive love in return. Spreading love also spreads happiness and joy, it makes everyone happy. Love can change the way we see people or things. Love changes it in a positive way, to always see the good side.\nWith love, our lives would be content and filled with positivity. We will always see the good in others and we, ourselves, will never judge a person. One should never judge a person because everyone is different and they shouldn’t be judged for being themselves. Love all, don’t spread hate. Be kind to everyone and love everyone. Don’t forget to love yourself too because before you can show love to anyone else, make sure that you love yourself first.\n References  http://sathyasai.org/sites/default/files/pages/study-guides/StudyGuide-Love.pdf   ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/love/","title":"Love"},{"content":" Swami simplifies our understanding of the principle of love with a saying: \u0026ldquo;Love in thought is Sathya, Love in action is Dharma, Love in feeling is Shanti and Love in understanding is Ahimsa\u0026rdquo;. Love is the hidden current for all the human values. When we speak with love, it is Sathya. When work is saturated with love, it is Dharma. Life lived according to these values gives peace. Love coming from a peaceful heart brings bliss. Love is the base of values and it should guide all our thoughts, words and actions.\nLove is Atma. Love is Wisdom. Love is Truth. Love is Righteousness. Love is Peace and Love is Non-Violence. Once you fill your heart with love, wicked feelings have no place in it.\nTruth is unity of thought, word and deed. When action is filled with truth it becomes Dharma. When all actions are right, peace reigns and one’s mind is free from all traces of violence.\nIn order to experience Prema, we first need to understand it. Take Prema as a shining light. If we want to experience this light, we should have a lightbulb. We also need electricity. Electricity here can be compared to Truth. When combining these 2 things we get to experience the light (Prema).\nThese values can be summarized as the following:\nLove + Thought = Sathya Love + Feelings = Shanti Love + Action = Dharma Love + Understanding = Ahimsa Ultimately, LOVE = HAPPINESS\n\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r In conclusion, The Bhagavad Gita once said that true happiness is born of the purity of one’s own mind. In my view, by practicing the 5 human values it not only brings happiness but purifies our thoughts, words and deeds as Sai Baba said \u0026ldquo;Happiness comes of its own accord as a result of one’s good deeds\u0026rdquo;.\n References   sssbpt.info/collections/StudyGuide-Love.pdf\n  Minakshi Biswal, Quality Education in Sri Sathya Sai Schools, An International Peer Reviewed, Scholarly Research Journal For Humanity Science And English Language.

The effort is always in our hands but more often than not the results aren’t. It is, however, in Swami’s hands. Therefore, it makes sense for us to focus all of our energy and time giving our best in the effort rather than focusing our time and energy on the outcome/results.\nThis thought then brings me to wonder how much effort is enough when we do something for Swami. Is it not the love and sincerity that matters?\nSwami has said\n\"Duty without love is deplorable; Duty with love is desirable; Love without Duty is Divine.\"\n\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r But then again how do we decide if our effort is enough? It is easy to justify our own actions by saying it is sufficient but how do we truly know if it is the best we can offer?\nAs always when we have questions in our hearts and minds, Swami will send us the answer in some form or another. The answer to my questions came through an online Satsangh by Team Radio Sai called ‘Can Destiny be Overcome?\n \r\r The first time I watched this satsangh session was in June 2020 but the message did not really hit me then. It was only when I watched it again sometime in October 2020 that the message in the session answered my questions. This just comes to show that (i) it is never a waste re-listening to Swami’s talks/discourses/satsanghs and (ii) Swami is always there to give us answers to our questions so long we look for it with an open mind.\nSwami says these two very beautiful quotes to summarise the answer on how we should perform our actions or carry out our duty.\n Kartavyam Yogam Ucyate (Performing One’s Duty is said to be Yoga) and Yogaha Karmasu Kaushalam (Excellence in Actions is Yoga).  This basically drives the message that in whatever we are doing, we need to give our full attention and perform the task as perfectly as possible because at the end of the day every action we perform is an offering to God. Swami’s students from His Institutions have shared many experiences on how Swami’s eye for detail is immeasurable in any activity that he embarks upon. If this does not serve as motivation for me to give my best, then probably nothing else can motivate me further. Below is a short video of a really cute incident that happened in Puttaparthi with a profound message from Swami on how we should strive for excellence in our actions.\n \r\r The two key learnings that I got from the satsangh is as follows:\n We should strive for excellence in our best possible manner. We should strive to be a better version of ourselves and to be better in the roles we play by improving ourselves. We should not strive for excellence by comparing ourselves with others and thinking that as long we are better than others, then that is excellence. We should strive to BETTER ourselves in whatever we do and offer our actions to Swami in every role we play whether it is at home, at work, in the community or in the Sai organization. By doing this we will become the best we can be in every aspect of life. After putting in our best efforts, we should then leave the results to Swami. Again, as Swami says, Karma Phala Tyaga (Renunciation of the Fruits of Action). We should not get too attached to the results because ultimately there are aspects that are beyond our control. We should be more process-oriented where we enjoy the process of performing the actions and not be result-oriented where we place our entire happiness in the outcome of the actions. God focuses on our actions and efforts, not the results; therefore, we should inculcate the same practice.  With this, I sincerely pray to Swami to help me remember this whenever I perform my actions and carry out my duty. I should never settle for good enough or mediocrity especially when I am doing something for Swami and ultimately, I should reach a point where every action I perform is for Swami.\n References   Link for points included in the content.\n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXQfW43MLcA    Link for the 2nd video.\n https://youtu.be/VawAQj7Ef9w     ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/my-best-for-swami/","title":"My Best For Swami"},{"content":" I learned this song in my Balvikas.\nThe meaning of this song is: O mind, worship the Lotus Feet of your God and Supreme Teacher, Sai Baba who will take you safely across the ocean of Samsara.

I was fortunate that my parents made this trip happen and I eagerly waited for the day to come for many months since they started planning for it.\nOur journey started at KLIA where we boarded the flight to Bangalore Airport, India. Puttaparthi is a town in Anantapur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Prashanti Nilayam is the place where Baba resided. When we reached Bangalore, we were greeted by Uncle Kishore who then drove us to Puttarparthi. Uncle Kishore was a humble and kind man. We reached Puttaparthi very late at night so we could not enter the gates of Prashanti Nilayam, therefore we had to put up a night at a hotel nearby. We went to sleep but woke up very early the next morning as I was so excited to see the much talked about place by my Balvikas and parents.\nTime had come, me and my sister got dressed in our white Punjabi suits and the loving Uncle Kishore fetched us from the hotel and drove us again to the Ashram. We reached the accommodation office and met some our friends Uncle Vimal and Aunty Ballet from Singapore who were eagerly waiting for us who greeted us with so much of love. We got our rooms and the experience from here was out of this world. We spent a lot of time in family satsangh and togetherness with our extended family from Singapore, Melbourne and Johor.\nWe got our map of the Ashram and started planning all that were going to do and places to visit and most importantly I wanted to have Western food! The things I enjoyed the most in Parthi was the food and bhajans. I had yummy ice cream, hot chocolate, toast and much more at the western canteen I frequented almost every day. Me and my sister spent most of our time at Bhajans, Vedic chanting, meals, visits to the mall and others with my mother, Aunty Ballet, Vidya and Vina Akka since they had strict rules of men and women being separated.\nThe bhajans were divine and I never missed a single bhajan. The atmosphere and surrounding was just so pleasant, calm and peaceful. Swami’s samadhi was divine and beautiful. We got to get his blessings everyday after bhajans.\nMy father made plans for us to visit Swami’s birth place, the Chitravathi river, Super Speciality Hospital, Kalpavriksha tree and few others. On the last day we visited the Chaitanya Jyothi Museum which was built 20 years ago to mark the 75th birthday of Baba. The museum spectacular and we also met Aunty Jaya who comes to Prashanti every year to serve at the Chaitanya Jyothi museum. It was nice to see her.\nMy experience in this whole adventure was wonderful and blissful. I would love to visit Prashanti again when the pandemic comes to an end.\n Gallery \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/abode-of-peace/img_shreya_eshani_1_hu96b410fa6ec7ac6a13d9944b30375074_153168_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpeg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/abode-of-peace/","title":"My Visit to the Abode of Supreme Peace"},{"content":"Fill in the answers to the Clues.\n\rCrossword Puzzle Maker\r\r\rdiv.puzzle\r{\rmargin:auto;\rdisplay:flex;\rflex-direction:column;\rheight:1000px;\rmax-width:700px;\r}\r Retrieved from https://saispeaks.sathyasai.org/puzzles/ ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/god-names/","title":"Names of Gods and Sages"},{"content":" We need to respect nature and living things because the environment is important.

But the oceans need our help. Saving the oceans can sometimes feel like an overwhelming task, but if we all pitch in, we can make a big difference.\nWe can save the ocean by practising the following habits:\n Conserve Water.

I decided that it was a great opportunity to take a breather from the hectic pace of life that I had become accustomed to. Rather than dwelling on the negativity and worrying unnecessarily over a virus that was restricting our way of life, I decided to make the most of the situation as best I could. The MCO gave me the opportunity to do all the things that I had always wanted to do but didn’t quite manage due to time constraints and quite frankly, some procrastination. Was I in for a surprise! With two teenagers at home and a husband still working as an essential services staff, I still had my hands full. My mum and I found ourselves in the kitchen most of the time, either cooking, cleaning or browsing through the internet for some easy recipes. It brought much joy in seeing our loved ones savouring our labour of love in preparing delicious and nutritious home cooked food.\nHowever, when the MCO was extended I spent the time venturing into other interesting and more introspective fields that caught my focus. I dwelled into the Upanishads, dabbled a little in Kundalini Yoga, immersed myself in Deepak Chopra’s 21-day Abundance Program and even signed up for Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering course. In my ardent quest to know “Who Am I”, I found myself embarking on a journey that made me realise that much self-reflection, introspection, contemplation and meditation are required. All the great gurus and sages say the answer is within us. So, we have to make that journey inwards. As inspirational author and guided meditation guru, Michaiel Bovenes says: “When there is nowhere else to turn to, turn inwards.” Equally wise words come from Rumi, an 18h century Persian poet, who said: “Silence is the language of God. All else is poor translation.” These great gurus are saying that only when the mind attains solitude that the truth is revealed. The Buddha is an exemplary model of this. After all, the Buddha attained Nirvana (in complete silence) through introspection, contemplation and meditation.\nPerhaps the answer to what we seek in search of inner peace and happiness does not necessarily come from the intellect which is confined by space and time. Perhaps it comes from ‘stillness’. It must be then true what the great sages say that silence expands the mind and liberates it. I am also told that the universe is within me. That the awesome and wondrous beauty of life emerges from within us. The DNA (Divine Nature of Awareness) is embedded in each and everyone of us and we need only to tap its infinite potential through prayer, self-reflection, introspection, contemplation and meditation. Rumi says: “We carry inside us the wonder we seek outside us. I looked in temples, churches and mosques, but I found the divine within my heart.” To summarise, in order to find who we are, each of us have to take the step inwards for therein lies the universe that we are all seeking.\nInitially I found it very abstract but as I ponder deeper, I am able to see glimpses of light that shed some focus on the journey of self-realisation that I have undertaken. I have started the journey and am eager to see where it is going to take me. I would like to conclude with two profound sayings that encapsulate my thoughts.\n\"When we turn the mind inwards, God manifests as the inner consciousness\"\nRamana Maharshi\n\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r \"The light of the Divine is within you.\"\nSathya Sai Baba\n\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r  ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/inner-peace/","title":"Seek And You Will Find The Inner Peace You Crave"},{"content":"Why is doing service important to you? How does the seva improve you as a person, as a spiritual aspirant and as a guru? \"The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.\"\nMahatma Gandhi\n\r\rdiv.quote\r{\rfont-style: italic; text-align:center;\rmargin-top: auto;\rmargin-bottom: auto;\rmargin-left: 2em;\rmargin-right: 2em;\r}\r Well, I don\u0026rsquo;t know that seva means performing without expecting a reward, a result or an outcome. Little did I know that Seva is a powerful tool to learn about myself, be it my inner self or my outer self. I have been doing it for my grandmother, father, mom, siblings and my school teachers continuously since I was a little girl. Then, Swami emerged into my life from a partially closed door to an opened door. He further enhanced me to realise that there is no greater service than service to mankind. Hence performing service, \u0026lsquo;Nara Seva, Narayan Seva\u0026rsquo; has become part and parcel of my life and I have become totally lost in it. I\u0026rsquo;m here for a reason and the reason is to render my service to mankind which is my utmost priority.\nService is meant to pursue one\u0026rsquo;s own interests for the betterment of oneself and as a collective gain. It is considered the most important part of any spiritual practice. I remind myself, if I love my guru then I must show it by doing seva with love and compassion. There are many types of services one can perform, either as a volunteer to feed the poor and the needy, being a counselor, a doctor, a nurse or a teacher.\nI chose to be a Balvikas Guru simply because teaching is my passion. Baba said, being a Guru is a noble profession. Filling a child\u0026rsquo;s mind at a tender age with holy and sacred thoughts guarantees a better person in the future. I believe Swami has given me this beautiful opportunity of nurturing and shaping the younger generation. I enjoy teaching kids tremendously because they bring a lot of joy to me. I also ensure I give and prepare all the opportunities for them to enjoy their childhood wholesomely. I always try my best to make a difference in a child\u0026rsquo;s life.\nThe most important part is that by doing seva as a Balvikas guru, it certainly without a doubt, transformed me into a better person. By coming up with lesson plans based on values, it allowed me to learn more about myself. It also guided me on what I need to do for my self-transformation and how I can set a good example for others. Conducting and running these classes gives me the chance to be associated with Swami. The time spent during the class opens me up to God, reminds me of His existence and His wonders in this world. Hence, I never forget to thank and appreciate Him for this birth.\nFurthermore, as a Balvikas Guru, I feel I am staying connected to His presence because the children in the class indirectly teach and infect me with their pure love. Their singing of bhajans and sketch performances gives me a sense of pleasure and not forgetting the moral values that I learn along with them.\nLast but not the least, I thank Swami for I am the chosen one in his Vision and Mission. Thanking him again for the opportunity to be His instrument, to transform the society and also myself.\n Gallery \r\r \r\r \r\r \r\r\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/service-of-love/service_of_love_4_huc9ad282602805e2b545e8ee3f43ac33d_63838_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/service-of-love/","title":"Service of Love"},{"content":" Shveta\u0026rsquo;s Trifle Pudding \r\r\r.pdfv {\rmargin: 10px auto 20px;\rdisplay: block;\r}\r  ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/trifle-pudding/","title":"Shveta's Trifle Pudding"},{"content":" Bhagwan Himself narrates a glimpse of amazing miracles towards mankind which is beyond one’s explanations. To comprehend Baba’s significant signs of wonders, we must delve faithfully to understand His glory and experience the element of divinity. The approach of love and affection that He showers upon all, is purely divine and magical. In a discourse on December 1976, He said that His manifestations were not to deceive and mislead the people but to attract, reconstruct, transform, and make them useful and serviceable for society.\nGenerally, He has taught us the path of compassion and love without boundaries. To gain His infinite love, we always sing His grace through bhajans. As He always preach, LOVE ALL, SERVE ALL. Sai Ram.\n During Swami’s childhood days, the miracles claimed by His family and people from His village left them speechless and stunned. On 8 March 1940, while living with his elder brother Seshama Raju in Uravakonda, a small town near Puttaparthi, 14-year-old Sathya was apparently stung by a scorpion. He lost consciousness for several hours and in the next few days underwent a noticeable change in behavior. There were \u0026ldquo;symptoms of laughing and weeping, eloquence and silence.\u0026rdquo; It is claimed that then \u0026ldquo;he began to sing Sanskrit verses, a language of which it is alleged he had no prior knowledge.\nHe is alleged to have been capable of materialising objects such as food and sweets out of thin air. On 23 May 1940, Sathya called household members and reportedly materialised sugar candy (prasad) and flowers for them.\nBhagawan’s appearance of miracle happenings are spontaneous with natural expressions. Baba has taken pains to stress the fact that He is no magic or mesmerism. He is genuinely divine power that creates objects and the universe. The appearance of holy ash and kum kum and creation of talisman, lockets and rings are just emblems of love to His devotees.\nAs He says; \u0026lsquo;Miracles are not part of my personality, but only a token of my love.\u0026rsquo;\nBaba had declared that the first sixteen (16) years of his life would be devoted to ‘leelas(miracles)’, the next sixteen (16) years to ‘mahimas’ and the remaining years would be preaching of upadesa (sermons). He further explains that all three, continues throughout his Avatar years with miracles, splendor and sermons. The significance of signs and wonders must be experienced and realized by the devotee himself. If hesitation persists due to self-pride and sensibility, acceptance of the miracles and divine presence fails.\nThere is countless evidence to prove that Swami creates what he wants. Even scientific research has made its entry on the scene.\n  Once there was a minor surgery procedure to remove a benign mole which caused the patient intense pain and restlessness, but mysteriously subsided and she had immediate relief as white flakes of Vibuthi fell in profusely on her face and body from the air. This incredible incident was described by the Professor’s wife. This is something beyond one’s belief of how it occurred. Since then, every Thursday, bhajans were carried out to spread grace and love of Sai.\n  The Summer Course of 1973 was in progress at Whitefield, Bangalore. One student, a habitual smoker, had promised Swami that he would not smoke again. Once when Swami asked him, he vehemently denied that he had smoked. In front of those present, Swami materialized a photograph, showing even the background of the place, where the boy was sitting and smoking.\n  Here\u0026rsquo;s another inexplicable miracle event that happened.\nOne day, when Swami spotted an old woman, who demanded nothing, he asked her, who her favourite God was. She replied that her husband was her favourite God. When she asked for a photo of her husband, who expired two years before Swami\u0026rsquo;s birth and who had never been photographed, Swami at once materialized it. The old woman, overcome with emotion, bowed at the feet of Swami.\nOne of Swami’s faithful devotees- Sri Raja Reddy lived with Swami for quite some time. One of his varied experiences is narrated below.\n\u0026ldquo;My mother was on her way to Kasi. Others were also with her. At that time, we were with Swami at Kodaikanal. Swami told me, \u0026ldquo;Now your mother is on the train traveling in this route. [He gave the location.] She has got a fever. As she entered the lavatory, she was about to fall. I rescued her. Now she is fine.\u0026rdquo; When the mother returned, she described all this.\nOne of the many experiences of Dr. Gadia, who runs the \u0026lsquo;Om Sathya Sai Dispensary\u0026rsquo; in Arusha in Africa, goes like this:\nIn 1962, one day at 2:30 p.m., Sai Baba asked Gadia to take down this note, \u0026ldquo;At present, your mother is being subjected to an operation in Kampala. Doctors are of the opinion that she cannot be saved. But I will give her a new life, I will make her well.\u0026rdquo;\nDr. Gadia immediately wrote to Kampala and from his brother\u0026rsquo;s reply found that whatever Baba had told was true. The letter\u0026rsquo;s content was that his mother, suffering from an intestinal ailment, was taken to the hospital, that the doctors conducted a surgery as the last resort and that the doctors had no hope of the success of the operation. It was also mentioned in the letter that his brother had applied Sai Vibhuti at the last moment, praying for the blessings of Swami. Another day at Brindavan, Swami informed Dr. Gadia, \u0026ldquo;I had been to Kampala yesterday to rescue your parents from a car accident.\u0026rdquo; The doctor learned about the actual incident later. Though the car was smashed, parents had a miraculous escape.\nSwami explains that the significance of gifts or tokens of love to His devotees. Is merely that grace is available to all who call on Me in My name or form, though not with these gifts. Love is that bond which wins grace.\nObviously, these Sai miracles have a deep symbolic purpose, they are not just idle acts meant to amaze crowds. This establishes the credentials of Lord Sai and these signs, which may be taken as wonders, pronounce the divine nature and mission of Sathya Sai Baba.\nAnd of course, there can be no better explanation than this of miraculous occurrences and significance of signs and wonder. On the contrary, one who has experienced the immeasurable love and compassion of Sai Baba, these miracles seem trivial.\nThe real purpose of divine signs and wonders is chiefly to enhance our faith in the divine, and to cement our bond with God, Swami says:\n \u0026lsquo;You may infer from what you call my miracles that I am causing them to attract and attach you to me and me alone. They are no intended to demonstrate or publicize. They are merely spontaneous and concomitant proofs of divine majesty\u0026rsquo;\n  References   Sai Baba – The Rose Fire of Heaven\n Narrated by: Professor Krishna Nandan Sinha Published by: Sterling Publishers Private Limited    Website Links\n http://saibaba.ws/miracles2/sathyasaimiracles.htm https://saisarathi.com/divine-discourses/signs-and-wonders/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sathya_Sai_Baba     ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/signs-wonders/","title":"Signs \u0026 Wonders Of Sathya Sai"},{"content":" Bhajan - Hara Shiva Shankara \r\r ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/sing-play/","title":"Sing and Play Harmonium"},{"content":" Bhajan - Jai Durga Lakshmi   ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/jai-durga/","title":"Singing Jai Durga Lakshmi"},{"content":"Inside these jumbled words are contained priceless quotes that our Beloved Bhagawan has advised us to follow.

I got the information to do the article in a few books and through internet search Google. This message is very important for me because so many people don\u0026rsquo;t know about the life story of Swami so I wanted everyone to know the story of Swami.\nNovember 23, 1926, is a red-lettered day in the history of mankind. On that day was born in the obscure village of Puttaparthi, a charming baby boy in the Ratnakara family. None realised then, and indeed for a long time thereafter, that Divinity had incarnated in human form as Ratnakara Venkata Satyanarayana Raju, grandson of Mr. Kondama Raju, and son of Pedda Venkama Raju and Easwaramma. In the Sathya Sai Incarnation, the Lord chose the Ratnakara family on account of the purity, piety, and the devotion of its members. Prior to the incarnation, Pedda Venkama Raju and Easwaramma had been blessed with one son and two daughters, Seshama Raju, Venkamma, and Parvathamma, in that order. Some years passed and Mother Easwaramma longed for another son. She observed all the prescribed austerities, and soon her prayers were answered - she was to become a mother again. Even before its birth, Easwaramma knew that the child to be born would be unusual. There was a definite reason for such a belief. Sometime prior to the birth of this new boy, Lakshmamma, the mother-in-law was engaged in the worship of Lord Sathyanarayana. The Lord then appeared in her dream and blessed her, indicating that He would be born in her family. Promptly, Lakshmamma alerted Easwaramma that the latter might have strange experiences, but ought not to worry about them. Shortly thereafter, Easwaramma had precisely one such experience.\nOne day as she was drawing water from the well, Easwaramma was startled by the sight of a big blue ball of light. The ball came directly towards her and entered her; Easwaramma fainted and fell. The Lord had entered her womb for the mandatory stay prior to physical birth as Sathyanarayana Raju. Thus, the Lord was not begotten, but immaculately conceived, even as His Son (Jesus) had been, two thousand years ago. Sathya was born in the early hours of November 23, 1926. There were a number of unusual incidents accompanying His birth, as also in His childhood (as in the case of Lord Krishna). Though they all gave strong hints of His Divinity, few realised until much later that Sathya was the Lord Himself. But all unfailingly recognised that Sathya was most unusual, extraordinarily intelligent, precocious, and above all, always full of Love and compassion. In Primary School, Sathya helped His classmates in diverse ways. Though from a poor family, He did not hesitate to give away His clothes to needy classmates. More importantly, He never lost an opportunity to turn the minds of His friends towards God. Among other things, He formed a bhajan group for this purpose, which later became very popular.\nIt was time to move on to Higher Secondary School, but such a school was available only in Bukkapatnam, several kilometers to the north of Puttaparthi. Young Sathya now had to trudge back and forth every day, no matter what the weather, the muddy path through fields, walking on bunds, and wading through water, as required. In the Bukkapatnam School too, He was a model student, ever helpful to others. Making students God-conscious remained His prime occupation, and to hold the attention of His mates, He would often materialise prasadam (gift-articles or vibhuti), much to their amazement. Sathya was an automatic choice for the class-leader (monitor), but this brought its share of problems. Once, His teacher asked Sathya to slap all the boys in the class for an infringement of discipline. Instead of slapping hard as he was expected to, Sathya merely patted the cheeks of the errant pupils. This greatly angered the teacher, who then directed all his wrath on the class-leader. Sathya bore the punishment in stoic silence; for Him, it was all a part of the Drama scripted by Him, and this particular scene was being enacted to impart some lessons to humanity.\nOn another occasion, the teacher handling a particular class-hour (period) noticed that Sathya was not writing down what was being dictated, while all other students did. When questioned, Sathya replied that He was not taking down because He already knew the lesson. Interpreting this response as gross impertinence, the teacher asked Sathya to stand up on the bench, a form of punishment popular in those days. Sathya obediently did. After a while the School bell rang, signalling the end of the period in progress, and the commencement of a new period. It was time for the teacher to leave the room and make way for another one who was to handle the next period. Mr. Mahboob Khan, this other teacher, entered the classroom and to his utter surprise saw Sathya standing upon the bench. Khan loved Sathya very much, and to him it was inconceivable that Sathya would have done anything to deserve a punishment. He also noticed that the teacher who had handled the previous period was not vacating the chair. To his astonishment he then discovered that this teacher was not getting up from the chair because he was stuck or glued to it - whenever the teacher tried to get up, the chair also lifted! In a flash, Khan understood the problem. He asked Sathya to get down from the bench and the stuck teacher promptly got his release! Years later Swami disclosed that this drama was staged not to inflict humiliation on the teacher concerned but to make people conscious of His Divine powers. Humiliation is something that does not exist in Swami\u0026rsquo;s dictionary. Around this time, Mr. Seshama Raju, Sathya’s older brother, went to Kamalapuram to stay with his in-laws, and also qualify there as a teacher. Kamalapuram boasted of a good school and Seshama Raju thought that this was the school where Sathya ought to study - the entire family pinned its hope on Sathya, and dreamt that one day He would go to college and eventually end up as a big officer in the Government. And so, to Kamalapuram, Sathya went.\nSeshma Raju\u0026rsquo;s in-laws, being relatively well heeled, looked down upon Sathya since He was quite poor. As a result, He was not only ill-treated but also called upon to perform arduous house-hold duties. He had, for example, to fetch drinking water every day from a far-off well. Such chores left scars, which remain to this day. In the Kamalapuram School, Sathya was a great favourite of the Drill Master who doubled also as the Scout Master. Once, there was to be a grand General Fair and Cattle Show in the neighbouring village of Pushpagiri. The Scout Master wanted his troop to go Pushpagiri and render service of the type scouts were expected to. A subscription of ten rupees was collected from each boy for meeting the various expenses connected with the trip, including the bus fare. Not having the required amount, Sathya excused Himself from joining the group but assured the Scout Master that He would somehow or the other be in Pushpagiri at the appointed time for duty. While His friends went by bus, Sathya walked the entire distance, with little to eat on the way. When He finally reached Pushpagiri, He was very tired but did not flinch from discharging His duties. Just before returning, He thoughtfully bought a few small gifts for folks back home. When He returned, what greeted Him was not appreciation for the gifts but a severe punishment because His absence had created problems with the supply of drinking water.\nMuch later, Swami revealed that He deliberately created such painful situations for Himself in order to teach the lesson of forbearance and equanimity. Despite the harsh treatment constantly administered, Swami has never ever criticised either His older brother or His sister-in-law, maintaining always that they were but mere instruments in His Drama, with specific roles to play. His teacher\u0026rsquo;s training concluded, Seshama Raju moved from Kamalapuram to Uravakonda to take appointment as a Telugu teacher in a school there. Sathya went along and joined that school. Once again, He excelled in everything, and became the cynosure of all eyes. But once He was back at home, it was the same painful routine; no let-up at all. And then, came the prophetic declaration. Sathya was stung by a scorpion one day. He was so sick that all the remedies that were used to cure him were to no avail. Eventually, the news was quickly reported to Sathya\u0026rsquo;s parents. Sathya’s parents were so heartbroken that they suspected that there could be evil spirits near him. Sathya’s father got suspicious when his behaviour changed. He armed himself with a big stick, approached Sathya, and asked \u0026ldquo;Who are You? Are You God, ghost, or devil?\u0026rdquo; The big moment had arrived and Sathya calmly replied,\n\u0026ldquo;I am Sai.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What are we to do with You?\u0026rdquo; Sathya replied, \u0026ldquo;Worship Me.\u0026rdquo;\nThe father\u0026rsquo;s next question was, \u0026ldquo;When?\u0026rdquo; Came the answer, \u0026ldquo;Every Thursday.\u0026rdquo;\n References  https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sathya-Sai-Baba   ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/swami-life-story/","title":"The Life Story Of Baba"},{"content":" Vijay and Raju were friends.

Anantapur (city in Andhra Pradesh) → Ananta = infinite, pur = body.\n A devotee should have staunch faith like the Mountain Penukonda (mount/fort in Anantapur city) –\u0026gt; Penu means big, konda means mountain. Therefore, our faith should be like a big mountain.\nIf we want to see God, we need to speak the truth. If we want to experience God, we should tread along the path of righteousness (Dharma). Dharmavaram (a city in Anantapur district) -\u0026gt; centre of Dharma.\nPuttaparthi → putta means anthill. Anthills have had numerous significance in our puranas. The author of Ramayana, Valmiki got immersed in a huge pile of sand (anthill) as he took severe penance. Lord Shiva has snakes around his neck. The snakes live in anthills. Lord Muruga is also associated with anthills (putta). Lord Venkateswara stayed in an anthill for a long time drinking the milk from the udder of a cow.\nThese are the reasons why Baba chose Puttaparthi.\n ","date":"2020-11-23T00:00:00Z","image":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-parthi/puttaparthi_huabeced3f6a1f25d04d68e9a587f9c2d6_592867_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://emagazine.ssbcbandarklang.org/p/baba-and-parthi/","title":"Why Baba Chose Parthi?"},{"content":"Bhagawan says, \u0026ldquo;Why fear when I am here\u0026rdquo;. \u0026ldquo;Fear\u0026rdquo; means fear of anything, imaginary or real, danger, disaster, or death. \u0026ldquo;When\u0026rdquo; means anytime, or all the time. \u0026ldquo;I am here\u0026rdquo; means \u0026ldquo;I am everywhere, I AM IN YOU and not outside you, not separate from you, wherever I am; in Prashanthi Nilayam, Brindavan or anywhere else.\nIn conclusion, we have no reason to fear as we have the Lord in our midst and have Him placed in our hearts. All we need to do is LOVE HIM dearly. We belong to Bhagawan, we are special indeed.
